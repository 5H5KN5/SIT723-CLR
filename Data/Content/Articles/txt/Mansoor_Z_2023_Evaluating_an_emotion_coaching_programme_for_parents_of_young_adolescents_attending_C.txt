Health Services (CAMHS) in New Zealand:

Abstract 
Background Early adolescence is a time of increased vulnerability for the development of common mental health 
conditions such as anxiety and depression (internalising outcomes). Current treatments such as cognitive-behavioural 
therapy and antidepressant medication are focused on the individual and have small effect sizes, particularly in real-
world clinical settings such as the public Child Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Parents are an important 
and under-utilised resource in treating these conditions in young adolescents. Teaching parents how to respond to 
their young person’s emotions can improve emotion regulation and reduce internalising outcomes. One emotion-
focused programme for parents of this age group is Tuning in to Teens (TINT). This is a structured, manualised skills 
group for parents only focused on teaching skills to coach young people through their emotional experiences. This 
study aims to investigate the impact of TINT in the clinical setting of publicly funded CAMHS in New Zealand.
Methods The trial will evaluate the feasibility of a two-arm multi-site randomised control trial (RCT). Participants 
will be 10–14-year-olds referred to CAMHS in Wellington, New Zealand, with anxiety or depression, and their par -
ents or guardians. Arm 1 will be parents attending and implementing TINT (in addition to the usual care received at 
CAMHS). Arm 2 will be usual care only. TINT groups will be facilitated by CAMHS clinicians who have been trained in 
the programme and will be delivered over 8 weekly sessions. Prior to the RCT, a co-design methodology will be used 
with service users to inform outcome measures used in the trial. A group of service users meeting the RCT criteria will 
be recruited to take part in workshops to help determine their priority outcomes. Measures based on the results of 
workshops will be included in the outcome measures. The primary feasibility outcomes will be the recruitment and 
retention of participants, acceptability of the intervention for service users and clinicians and acceptability of outcome 
measures.
Discussion There is a need to improve outcomes for the treatment of adolescent anxiety and depression. TINT 
is a programme with the potential to enhance outcomes for those accessing mental health services by providing

targeted support to parents of adolescents. This trial will inform whether a full RCT is feasible to evaluate TINT. Includ-
ing service users in the design will increase its relevance of an evaluation in this setting.

Background
The transition from childhood to adolescence is a time of 
change and challenge. One in four adolescents will expe -
rience a common mental health condition such as anxiety 
or depression, with these conditions accounting for 16% 
of the global burden of disease in this age group [1, 2]. 
Early adolescence is a particularly vulnerable period, with 
half of all mental health conditions in adolescence devel -
oping by age 14 years [2, 3]. Longitudinal studies have 
consistently found mental health difficulties in child -
hood, and adolescence predicts poorer mental health and 
wellbeing in adulthood [4, 5].
In New Zealand, Child and Adolescent Mental Health 
Services (CAMHS) provide publicly funded care for ado -
lescents with moderate to severe mental health difficul -
ties. These services face increasing demand, with rising 
rates of mental health difficulties in young New Zealand -
ers, particularly for Māori, the indigenous population 
of New Zealand [6]. As the prevalence of mental health 
conditions has risen, referrals to CAMHS have also 
increased, particularly for the 10–14 year age group [7].
Family systems theory describes the importance of the 
family unit as a whole in child development. Parents play 
a crucial role in shaping a child’s health and wellbeing 
through their relationships and family dynamics. Con -
sistent with this theory, a variety of parenting factors are 
significantly related to adolescent depression and anxi -
ety [8]. With various barriers to accessing mental health 
support for young people, families are also likely to be 
the first (and often only) source of support available [9]. 
Despite the rationale for including parents as treatment 
targets for this population, treatments are often individu -
ally focused with the first-line treatment for adolescent 
anxiety and depression typically Cognitive Behaviour 
Therapy (CBT) and/or antidepressant medication [10].
While there is a reasonable body of evidence for the 
effectiveness of CBT in younger populations, effect sizes 
are often small and a systematic review of CBT for youth 
anxiety has found this may be negligible when compared 
to active control conditions such as guided self-help [11]. 
There is also evidence that effect sizes for CBT and other 
talking therapies are smaller for adolescent versus adult 
populations [12]. A recent review and meta-analysis of 
antidepressant medication in children and adolescents also found effect sizes to be small [13]. The effectiveness 
of individually focused treatments is further reduced 
when caring for adolescents with substantial mental 
health needs in settings like CAMHS, where family and 
other systematic factors frequently contribute to the 
complexity of their challenges [10].
In New Zealand, there is an obligation under Te Tiriti 
ō Waitangi (The Treaty Of Waitangi) to bicultural prac -
tice that meets the needs of indigenous Māori. Models 
of Māori wellbeing such as ‘Te Whare Tapa Wha’ (The 
House with Four Sides) include whānau (roughly trans -
lated as family, however, encompassing a wider meaning 
of social networks) as a key pillar of health [14]. Treat -
ment options that include parents and caregivers are 
important to align with this perspective. Consistent with 
this, a survey of Māori accessing CAMHS found family 
involvement a key variable in satisfaction with care [15]. 
This is also likely to be relevant for other priority ethnic 
groups in New Zealand including Pacific peoples [16].
Parent interventions can be broadly divided into 
behaviour or emotion-focused interventions. Behaviour-
focused interventions typically focus on modifying child 
behaviour through the use of rewards, punishments, 
structured routines and clear expectations. Emotion-
focused parent interventions focus on improving par -
ent-child relationships and emotion regulation. An 
emotion-focused approach may be particularly indicated 
for an older age group and where internalising problems 
are the focus. A review of emotion-focused parenting 
interventions found positive impacts on a range of parent 
and child-related outcomes, including emotion regula -
tion [17]. This review did not include meta-analysis and 
the included studies generally covered programmes for 
younger age groups with less evidence for adolescents.
Tuning in to TeensTM (TINT) is an emotion-focused 
intervention for parents tailored specifically to this age 
group. This programme has been adapted from a pro -
gramme for younger children, Tuning in to KidsTM, 
developed by a team at the University of Melbourne 
[18]. These are evidence-based programmes based on 
research into emotion socialisation, the processes of 
learning about emotions and how parents can promote 
their children’s emotional intelligence [13]. TINT aims 
to support parents to better ‘tune in’ to the emotions of 
Page 3 of 12
 Mansoor et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:70 
 
their children by becoming ‘emotion coaches’ . Emotion 
coaching is defined as an adaptive emotion socialisation 
style which encourages understanding and acceptance 
of emotional experience [19]. This style of responding 
is associated with better mental wellbeing, along with 
other positive outcomes such as improved social skills 
and academic performance [19, 20]. In contrast to emo -
tion coaching, other styles of responding to emotions 
such as permissive, dismissive, or disapproving responses 
are linked to poorer mental health [8]. The TINT pro -
gramme also includes information on typical adolescent 
development and other strategies for regulating emotion 
such as relaxation and mindfulness techniques.
There is evidence for the benefit of TINT in the 10–14 
age group in a community setting from a randomised 
control trial in Melbourne, Australia [19]. Participants 
were young adolescents transitioning to high school 
(n=224, mean age=12, 49% boys) and their primary car -
egivers, who were randomised by the school to either 
receive TINT or not. Caregivers who completed the 
programme had significant improvements in their own 
emotion regulation skills, a change in their parenting 
responses towards increased emotion coaching and these 
changes were associated with reduced internalising diffi -
culties in their young adolescents [19, 21].
In New Zealand, several CAMHS have been imple -
menting TINT with positive anecdotal feedback, how -
ever, the programme has not been formally evaluated. As 
this will be the first study to evaluate TINT in CAMHS 
in New Zealand, a feasibility trial has been chosen to 
assess the various research challenges in this real-world 
setting before embarking on a larger-scale trial. While 
randomised experimental designs are gold-standard for 
testing effectiveness in health settings, testing feasibil -
ity factors on a smaller scale before proceeding to larger 
and more resource-intensive trials is recommended when 
interventions are complex and interact with other factors 
[22]. There is also evidence from a previous RCT looking 
at a manualised approach to delivering CBT across sev -
eral CAMHS in New Zealand that recruitment rates were 
lower than expected, and there was difficulty recruiting 
representative numbers of Māori and other priority eth -
nicity groups [23]. A national inquiry into Mental Health 
in 2018 reported a 70% increase in demand for CAMHS 
between 2006 and 2016, while at the same time not -
ing significant workforce shortages across the field [24]. 
These continue to be critical issues in the field that may 
impact research feasibility.
As the overall aim of an evaluation is to determine 
treatment effectiveness in a specific setting, there is also 
a question of how outcomes should be measured. In 
health research, service-user and research or clinician 
agendas may not align [25]. For instance, drug trials are given preference by researchers whilst non-drug treat -
ments are preferred by service users [18, 19]. In youth 
mental health, as outcomes are often focused on individ -
ual symptoms, these may not reflect other mechanisms 
of systemic change or what is meaningful for young peo -
ple and families [26]. To address this, the current study 
will include a novel co-design methodology working with 
parents and young adolescents to input into the meas -
ures used in the trial. This is a unique and contemporary 
approach intended to maximise the relevance of findings 
to service users in this complex real-world setting. Ser -
vice users will be asked about their priority outcomes for 
a programme like TINT so that this can be incorporated 
into the programme evaluation.
Aims
The primary aim of this study is to examine the feasibility 
of a randomised control trial (RCT) of an intervention for 
parents, Tuning in to Teens TM (TINT), delivered in addi -
tion to usual care for young adolescents aged 10–14 years 
who have presented to mental health services with a pri -
mary difficulty related to anxiety or depression. The fea -
sibility study will aim to identify and address issues that 
may arise in the current CAMHS context in New Zea -
land. The specific objectives will include the assessment 
of factors related to the recruitment and retention of par -
ticipants, acceptability and feasibility of the intervention 
and acceptability and feasibility of outcome measures. A 
secondary aim is to include service users in the develop -
ment and decision making around how to measure the 
impact of TINT in CAMHS. The aim of this is to incor -
porate a measure that will capture specific service user 
needs in our community so this can be included in deci -
sion making around the benefit of this intervention.
The results of this feasibility study will inform the 
future development of a full-scale RCT to test the 
hypothesis that this additional parent-focused interven -
tion will improve outcomes for young adolescents with 
internalising difficulties in a clinical child and adolescent 
mental health setting. Testing the feasibility of the study 
design will ensure that any larger-scale trial is conducted 
in a manner that is both scientifically rigorous and fea -
sible in this real-world setting. Including a service-user 
perspective in outcome measures will help ensure rel -
evance for those the intervention is intended to benefit.
Methods/design
Study design
This feasibility study has a mixed methods design with 
two phases:
Phase I: The first phase of the study will use a co-
design methodology to determine how the impact of 
Page 4 of 12 Mansoor et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:70 
TINT is measured in the trial. This methodology has 
been chosen to increase the relevance of the research 
in line with a broader objective of making sure that 
we are meeting service user needs in CAMHS. Co-
design has proven value in other health settings in 
New Zealand [26–28]. In co-design, service users are 
viewed as experts alongside clinicians and research -
ers who work together to integrate their experiences. 
A group of 10–14-year-olds engaged with CAMHS 
in the Wellington region, and their parents will be 
recruited to participate in a co-design workshop. 
Workshops will be facilitated by the research team 
with the aim of co-designing an outcome measure to 
be included in an evaluation of TINT. The co-design 
process will be guided by a multi-stage approach 
incorporated in other New Zealand health research 
projects: engage, plan, explore, develop, decide and 
change [29]. Following the exploration and develop -
ment of themes in the workshops, a measure will be 
drafted for each group (parents and 10–14-year-olds) 
for inclusion in the trial. This may take the form of an 
adaption of existing questionnaires or an additional 
question or scale to be included.
Phase II: The second and final phase of the study will 
be a feasibility study using an experimental meth -
odology of a randomised control trial (RCT). There 
will be two arms to the trial:
1. TINT for parents + usual care in CAMHS.
2. Usual care in CAMHS only.
The comparison of TINT plus usual care with usual 
care only (described later) gives a pragmatic and ethi -
cal comparator in a real-world clinical setting. This 
design also gives an accurate representation of practice 
in CAMHS where different types of interventions are 
often layered together. If a larger scale trial is feasible, this 
design will allow for testing of the hypothesis that adding 
TINT to usual care improves outcomes for young adoles -
cents in CAMHS.
Participants will be randomly allocated to a study 
arm. For those allocated to receive TINT in addition 
to usual care, parents will complete a TINT group pro -
gramme at CAMHS (described later). TINT groups 
will be facilitated by at least two CAMHS clinicians and 
involve eight sessions of 2 h each week. Those allocated 
to control will be given the option of completing TINT 
after the study period. Outcome measures will be col -
lected prior to starting groups (T0), immediately after 
completing TINT/matched for the control arm (T1) and 
8 weeks after completing TINT/matched for the control 
arm (T2). See Fig.  1, the flow chart of phase II RCT. The 
trial will follow the Standard Protocol Items for Clinical Trials (SPIRIT) statement [30]. See Fig.  2 for the schedule 
of enrolment, interventions and assessments for phase II 
RCT and SPIRIT checklist in additional files (Additional 
file 1: SPIRIT checklist).
Study setting
The setting for this study is CAMHS services in the Wel -
lington region of New Zealand. New Zealand is a high-
income country with a population of around 5 million 
people of mixed ethnicities. Its history and culture have 
been affected by European colonisation with ongoing 
impacts on the indigenous population of Māori. Welling -
ton is the capital city, and the greater Wellington region 
is home to around 550,000. Based on 2018 census data, 
the regional population was 74.6% European/Pākehā, 
14.3% Māori, 8.4% Pacific peoples, 12.9% Asian and 3.3% 
other ethnicities [31]. CAMHS form part of the public 
health service in New Zealand which provides free uni -
versal care to eligible citizens, funded by general taxes 
[32]. Public health services have been administered by 20 
regional District Health Boards (DHBs), which as of 2022 
are in the process of integration into one national admin -
istrative body. In the greater Wellington region, there are 
five mainstream CAMHS and two speciality services: 
one for Māori families and one for Pacific peoples. Those 
from Māori or Pacific communities may choose whether 
to access mainstream or speciality services.
Participants
Participants will be young adolescents aged 10–14 years 
who have been referred to CAMHS with a presenting 
difficulty related to anxiety or depression, and their par -
ents or guardians (including non-birth parents e.g. step-
parents, other family members in a parenting role or legal 
guardians). Participant criteria will be the same for both 
phases so that those designing the measure are from the 
same population intended for the evaluation. Although 
TINT is a parent-only intervention, 10–14-year-olds will 
also be asked to provide outcome data on their internal -
ising symptoms and proposed mechanisms of change 
related to parenting and emotion regulation.
Inclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria for adolescents are as follows:
• Aged 10 to 14 years at the time of recruitment.
• Accepted into a CAMHS in the Wellington region.
• Primary presenting difficulty related to anxiety 
(including any DSM-5 Anxiety Disorder) or depres -
sion (including any DSM-5 Depressive Disorder).
• Sufficiently competent and fluent in the English 
language to complete outcome measures.

Page 7 of 12
 Mansoor et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:70 
 
Exclusion criteria
• Presenting difficulty is not anxiety/depression.
• Communication difficulty (e.g. lacking fluency in 
English or having a learning difficulty which impacts 
the ability to give consent or complete outcome 
measures).
Recruitment and target sample size
All participants will be recruited through participat -
ing CAMHS. General information about the study will 
be provided to these services and advertised via printed 
material displayed in waiting rooms and other public 
areas of these services. Clinical staff members may also 
send out individual invitations to current service users 
who may meet the study criteria. Interested participants 
will be invited to contact the research team directly.
Recruitment for phase I (co-design) will aim to recruit 
six to ten parent participants and six to ten 10 to 14-year-
olds. Recruitment for phase II, the RCT feasibility study, 
will aim to recruit 50 participants (25 per arm) as an 
approximate upper limit: the total numbers recruited 
in the study period will form part of the feasibility 
assessment.
As per guidelines for feasibility trials, the sample size 
for the feasibility trial has been set to address feasibility 
questions rather than a full-scale RCT and within the 
constraints of the study budget and time frame [33]. The 
planned time frame for referral is one quarter of a school 
year. In the target range across local services, there are 
approximately 150 total referrals per quarter [34].
There are a recommended number of a maximum of 
eight to twelve participants per TINT group or approxi -
mately five to six families (assuming two family members 
join If all five possible sites run an intervention group in 
the study period this sets an upper limit of approximately 
30 families per arm or 60 families overall in that quarter. 
The final sample size will give a reasonable estimate on 
per-quarter recruitment. For example, if 50 families are 
recruited, the true per-quarter recruitment rate would 
fall between 37 and 66 families (95% confidence interval). 
The calculation of the recruitment rate out of eligible ser -
vice users will have a precision of ±8% (confidence inter -
val for recruitment rate). This will enable calculations of 
the time frame needed for a fully powered trial.
Consent and eligibility
The principal investigator will provide further infor -
mation to those who express interest in the study, 
screen them for inclusion/exclusion criteria and obtain 
informed consent. All potential participants will be provided with written information about the study and 
provided with options to discuss the study based on their 
personal preference (phone, face to face, email, text). 
For those aged 10 to 14, an assessment of their ability to 
provide informed consent will be made by the principal 
investigator who has expertise working with young peo -
ple in mental health settings. This may include obtaining 
additional information from family members and/or the 
care team at CAMHS as required, for example, to deter -
mine the presence of any learning or cognitive difficulties 
that may impact the ability to consent. For those requir -
ing support to provide consent, this will be sought from 
a parent/guardian with assent sought from the young 
adolescent. Participants may withdraw at any time on 
their own request without providing a reason. For the 
first phase, the co-design of measure recruitment will be 
targeted at both 10–14-year-olds and their parents. For 
the second phase, the feasibility RCT, recruitment will 
be targeted at parents as the primary contacts, with their 
children then asked for consent to complete outcome 
measures (optional).
Randomisation, allocation and blinding
Randomisation and allocation apply to phase II (RCT 
feasibility). A pre-determined allocation sequence will 
be created by the team statistician (JS) and uploaded to 
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) trial man -
agement software [35]. Allocation will be on a 1:1 basis 
(i.e. equal size groups for intervention and control arm).
As separate TINT groups will be run in each partici -
pating service, separate randomisation schedules will be 
constructed for each centre to allow allocation on this 
basis. Randomisation schedules will be constructed using 
a permuted block randomisation [36] with a mean block 
length of 4 allocations (2 intervention, 2 control). Partici -
pants will be recruited during one school term (approx -
imately 10 weeks) with the intervention run in the 
following term. This randomisation schedule will allow 
for accrual over the term and participants to be notified 
of allocation as they enter the study.
Following confirmation of eligibility and informed 
consent, participant data will be entered in REDCap 
which will be used to draw the next allocation from the 
random allocation sequence for the appropriate ser -
vice (the allocation schedule is not visible). The research 
team member responsible for this step will communi -
cate these allocations to relevant staff members to coor -
dinate running the TINT groups. Due to the nature of 
the intervention, participants and clinicians will not 
be blind to intervention status; however, the researcher 
collecting the outcome data will be blinded to alloca -
tion when recording outcomes to reduce the risk of bias. 
Page 8 of 12 Mansoor et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:70 
The analysis will be conducted blind to outcome status, 
including leaving analysis of responses regarding the per -
ception of the TINT sessions until after the main analy -
sis is complete and the study subsequently unblinded for 
reporting.
Intervention
TINT is designed to be delivered in a group format over 
weekly sessions of 2 h each. It is a parent-only interven -
tion. An 8-week format will be used for the study as the 
recommended format for clinical settings. The focus of 
sessions is teaching emotion coaching skills. Parents are 
taught key steps to emotion coaching with a focus on 
awareness, listening and acceptance and then, if neces -
sary, problem-solving or negotiating boundaries with 
their adolescent.
Sessions also include information about adolescent 
development, teaching of emotion regulation skills such 
as mindfulness (for parents and adolescents) and sup -
porting parents to reflect on their own beliefs about emo -
tions based on their life experiences. Sessions are clearly 
structured, and a manual is provided to facilitators to 
guide sessions. Each session includes a mix of teaching, 
shared reflection and practicing skills. As much as possi -
ble, parents are encouraged to practice emotion coaching 
skills with each other using ‘live’ examples from home life 
and to practice at home in between sessions. Each ses -
sion has a specific focus, for example, managing fear, or 
managing anger and conflict. Handouts are provided for 
each session to allow parents to review the material. A 
fidelity checklist for each session is used for facilitators 
to complete to check adherence to programme content. 
For further details, see TIDieR table (Additional file  2: 
TIDieR table for TINT).
Training
Prior to the start of phase II RCT, participating clinicians 
not already trained in TINT will attend training run by 
the programme creators from the University of Mel -
bourne. Regular trainings for TINT are run online and 
up to four clinicians from each participating team will be 
trained. This training is being provided for the study by 
the programme creators.
Comparator: usual care in CAMHS
CAMHS are multidisciplinary teams that may include 
mental health nurses, social workers, family therapists, 
psychiatrists, and psychologists, who typically have 
additional training and expertise in working with young 
people and families. Based on the most recent national 
stocktake of this workforce, most staff in community 
CAMHS are in a clinical role (84%) and are composed of nurses (23%), social workers (18%), psychologists (16%), 
occupational Therapists (9%) and Psychiatrists (7%) [7]. 
Between 2018 and 2020/21, there was a 15% staff turno -
ver rate nationally [7].
A case manager is typically assigned to each referred 
young person to coordinate care. The case manager may 
also be a treating clinician. Care plans are discussed and 
reviewed within the multidisciplinary team. Wait time 
to begin treatment varies depending on service capacity, 
with variation in wait times to receive different interven -
tion services. For example, a young person may have to 
wait to start medication due to low psychiatry resource 
but may be able to start talking therapy sooner, or vice 
versa. For those with primary difficulties related to anxi -
ety or depression, usual care may include any or a combi -
nation of case management, antidepressant medication, 
individual talking therapy (e.g. CBT), other therapies 
including group or family-based sessions, and/or liaison 
with the school and other agencies [7]. Data will be col -
lected from all participants about the frequency and form 
of contact with CAMHS during the study period.
TINT is a structured manualised programme that will 
not be occurring in services as part of usual care outside 
of the research. However, as clinicians providing usual 
care may also be trained in TINT, there is potential for 
contamination of some content into usual care. Based 
on preliminary information collected from services, due 
to staffing and resource constraints, it is unlikely that 
clinicians facilitating TINT groups will also be provid -
ing a substantial amount of separate parent work. While 
this further reduces the likelihood of overlap of content 
in usual care, to assess this data will be collected on the 
number of total trained clinicians in a team, how many 
provided usual care during the study period and where 
possible, the amount of TINT content that may have 
been included in usual care sessions. Results from this 
will form part of the feasibility outcomes.
Feasibility outcomes
Recruitment and retention feasibility outcomes include 
the following:
• Service participation: assessed by the number of 
services involved across the region.
• Recruitment rates: assessed as the numbers of par -
ticipants expressing interest in the study, number 
of eligible participants and number who consent to 
participate.
• Retention rates: assessed by the number of partici -
pants who consent and:

Acceptability and feasibility of the intervention include 
the following:
• Clinician adherence to TINT: assessed by session 
fidelity checklists (provided in the TINT manual).
• Participant engagement: assessed by attendance 
records at group sessions.
• Participant and clinician experience: assessed by 
post-programme questionnaires, including barriers 
to attendance and learning.
• Depending on the results of other feasibility out -
comes, interviews may be conducted with partici -
pants and/or clinicians e.g. if a particular issue is 
identified that warrants further exploration.
• Separation of TINT content from usual care: 
assessed by a number of total trained clinicians in

Acceptability and feasibility of outcome measures
• Acceptability of co-design measure and other 
included measures assessed by completion rates.
Outcome measures
It is anticipated that at least one co-designed outcome 
measure will be included alongside one or more previ -
ously validated measures (described below). This co-
designed measure will not be externally validated but 
will be intended for use with this trial and may take the 
form of an additional questionnaire, scale or amendment 
of pre-existing standardised measures. Participants will 
receive a gift voucher on completing outcome measures 
as a thank you and to promote retention. All outcomes 
will be administered and recorded through REDCap. 
The following standardised quantitative measures will 
be included based on previous research with TINT and 
this age group and proposed mechanisms of a change via 
changes in emotional response and regulation [4].
The emotions as a child scale (EAC)
To measure changes in parent’s responses to their chil -
dren’s emotions, the Emotions as a Child scale will be 
used. The Emotions as a Child Scale (EAC) is a 45-item 
measure assessing parent responses to anger, sadness and 
anxiety, with 15 items per emotion [37]. There are par -
ent and youth forms which are identical other than the phrasing of perspective, with the parent form asking how 
the parent responds to their child’s emotions; and the 
youth form asking how the youth perceives their parent’s 
responses. The EAC has five subscales: parental encour -
agement, parental punishing responses, parental neglect, 
parental matching or magnifying and parental overrid -
ing of emotion. There are no clinical cutoff scores for this 
measure. Previous studies have shown acceptable inter -
nal consistency, test–retest reliability and validity metrics 
for various versions of the EAC with both adolescent and 
adult samples [38–40] [4].
Difficulties in emotion regulation short form (DERS‑SF)
To measure changes in emotional regulation for par -
ents and children, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation 
Short Form (DERS-SF) will be used. This is an 18-item 
self-report questionnaire and is a shortened form of the 
original 36-item version [41]. There are six subscales: 
nonacceptance of emotions, difficulties engaging in 
goal-directed behaviour when experiencing negative 
emotions, impulse control difficulties, lack of emotional 
awareness, limited access to emotion regulation scales 
and lack of emotional clarity [41]. Items are rated from 
1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). There are no 
clinical cutoffs for this scale, and higher scores indicate 
greater difficulties in emotion regulation. The shortened 
form has been chosen to minimise the burden for par -
ticipants and has comparable psychometric properties 
to the full version in both adult and adolescent samples 
[42]. Parents and 10–14-year-olds will be given the same 
self-report form and asked to respond about their own 
emotional regulation.
The revised child anxiety and depression scale 25 (RCADS‑25)
To measure changes in child internalising symptoms, 
The Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale 25 
(RCADS-25) will be used. This a questionnaire with self- 
and parent-report forms assessing symptoms of anxiety 
and depression [43]. The parent form asks about their 
view of their child’s whilst the child self-report form 
asks the child about their own experiences. In its origi -
nal form, the RCADS contains 47 questions and can be 
interpreted using its composite subscales which assess 
different types of anxiety and depressive disorders. As the 
objective of the current study is to look at overall anxiety 
and depression symptoms and to minimise demands on 
participants, the shorter form RCADS-25 will be used. 
This provides an overall depression score, an overall anxi -
ety score and a total internalizing score. In interpreting 
results, meaningful improvement has been suggested as 
at least a 50% reduction in the raw score or at least a 25% 
reduction for youth with treatment-resistant depression 
or remission defined as a T-score under 65 [44, 45]. The 
Page 10 of 12 Mansoor et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:70 
RCADS-25 has good psychometric properties for both 
overall anxiety and depression score [46, 47].
Other data
To provide further information about the impact of 
TINT, a pre- and post-programme questionnaire will 
be completed by parents adapted from the programme 
developers. This will include set questions e.g. ‘How 
would you rate your ability to respond effectively to 
your child’s emotions?’ as well as space for open-ended 
feedback.
To assess usual care in CAMHS, all participants will 
be given a checklist to complete to identify the type and 
quantity services they received from CAMHS during the 
study period e.g. individual therapy, crisis intervention 
and medication.
Demographic information will be collected from par -
ticipants including age, ethnicity and socio-economic 
status. Participant addresses will be collected to calcu -
late the New Zealand Index of Deprivation as an esti -
mate of socioeconomic status [48]. Guidance from 
Statistics New Zealand will be used for questions on 
ethnicity, gender and education.
Data analysis
Analysis for the feasibility trial will be largely descriptive. 
Variables related to recruitment and retention, accept -
ability and feasibility of the intervention and acceptability 
and feasibility of the outcome measures will be described. 
This will include appropriate summary statistics (e.g., 
percentages reporting aspects as acceptable).
The statistical analyses for preliminary effect sizes from 
outcome measures will depend on the final measures 
chosen but will likely follow common methods for con -
tinuous outcomes (e.g. random-effects models). A for -
mal statistical analysis plan will be produced prior to the 
start of data analysis. Analyses of trial outcomes will be 
based on intention-to-treat principles. The analysis will 
include interim measurements to allow the inclusion of 
participants with partial follow-up. Methods allowing for 
more complex handling of missing data will not be feasi -
ble within this initial study. A summary of any participant 
and clinician feedback will be reported.
Progression criteria
The primary progression criterion for a fuller trial is the 
recruitment rate per quarter (as an absolute count). The 
current projection for a fuller trial suggests a sample size 
of at least 140 participants per arm (280 in total). The fea -
sibility recruitment rate per quarter would need to be at 
least n=35 over 2 years of recruitment across study sites. 
Falling substantially short of this criterion would suggest that a subsequent study would need to recruit from a 
larger number of sites, potentially including a multi-
region study and/or by recruiting across a longer period. 
This could also include expanding the team to include 
Māori and Pacific researchers to increase engagement 
with these groups as a previous trial in this area had had 
difficulty recruiting representative numbers from differ -
ent ethnic groups [49].
Data monitoring
The primary investigator will monitor outcome measure 
data. Any concerns or adverse events will be reported 
to the research team and responded to according to the 
need for example, communicating back to the treating 
team.
Protocol amendments
It is anticipated that the co-design phase will lead to the 
amendment of outcome measures. There may also be 
amendments in response to feasibility findings as the trial 
progresses for instance related to recruitment. Any sub -
stantial amendments will be submitted to the overseeing 
ethics authority (Health and Disability Ethics Committee 
New Zealand).
Discussion
The transition to adolescence comes with a sharp 
increase in the risk of developing a common mental 
health condition such as depression or anxiety [2]. With 
the prevalence of these conditions increasing over time in 
New Zealand as elsewhere, public mental health services 
for children and adolescents face increasing demand [7]. 
Parents are an important and under-utilised resource in 
treating common mental health difficulties in young ado -
lescents. This is partly due to a lack of established evi -
dence-based interventions. TINT is a possible addition 
to improve CAMHS treatment. This study will investi -
gate the feasibility of a randomised control trial of TINT 
in CAMHS. Including service users in how we measure 
the impact of this intervention will maximise the rele -
vance of an evaluation in this real-world setting.
Trial status
Recruitment is currently ongoing and estimated through 
to end of 2022/early 2023.
