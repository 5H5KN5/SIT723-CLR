Abstract  
Objective:  A randomised trial informed by the Health Action Process Approach evaluated interventions 
to improve cardiac rehabilitation completion. This study investigated indirect effects of the interventions 
on cardiac rehabilitation adherence via targeted constructs. Methods: In this quantitative theory -based 
process evaluation, participants in all three trial arms (usual care; mailouts; mailouts plus telephone 
support) c ompleted a questionnaire at 12 months follow -up assessing intention, goal priority, outcome 
expectancies, risk perception, self -efficacy, social support, action planning, and coping planning. 
Consecutive sampling was used until the target sample size (167 per arm) was met. Completion of 
cardiac rehabilitation at the same time point  was self -reported. We used multiple regression mediation 
models to explore indirect effects. Results:  In total, 594 participants completed the cardiac 
rehabilitation questionnair e; 588 were analysed (6 excluded due to missing data). For mailouts alone, 
there were no significant indirect effects. There were small indirect effects of mailouts plus telephone 
support on intention via goal priority, outcome expectancies, and self -effic acy, with a negative effect via 
severity risk perception. There were also small indirect effects on cardiac rehabilitation completion via 
self-efficacy and action planning. Conclusions:  Findings suggest that mailouts plus telephone support 
increased the li kelihood of completing cardiac rehabilitation by enhancing self -efficacy and action 
planning, and increased intention by enhancing goal priority, self -efficacy, and outcome expectancies, 
with an unintended consequence of a negative effect via risk percepti ons. Conducting theory -based 
process evaluations alongside trials of behaviour change interventions can clarify mechanisms of action, 
which can inform efforts to refine interventions and to replicate and generalize findings to other 
jurisdictions .

Interventions supporting cardiac rehabilitation completion: process evaluation investigating theory -
based mechanisms of action  
Clinical guidelines recommend that patients complete cardiac rehabilitation after hospitalization 
for a myocardial infarction (MI) (CACPR, 2009; NICE, 2013) . Internationally, c ardiac rehabilitation 
programs focus on  health behaviour change and typically include exercise training, education about 
heart health, and counselling to reduce stress (Anderson & Taylor, 2014; Grace, Bennett, et al., 2014; 
O’Gara et al., 2013) . In Ontario, Canada, the setting of this study, programs are typically delivered 2 -3 
times a week over 5 months (Grace, Bennett, et al., 2014; Ndegwa, 2010) , within a hospital by an 
interprofessional team (Polyzotis et al., 2012) . A Cochrane systematic review found that attending 
exercise -based cardiac rehabilitation significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular mor tality compared 
to no exercise (27 trials; risk ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.86) (Anderson et al., 2016) . However, existing 
programs are under -utilized, limiting their impact on population health. Surveys in many countries 
indicate that only 30% of eligible patients participate in cardiac rehabilitation (Bethell et al., 2001; 
Kotseva et al., 2009; Suaya et al., 2007) . Fewer still complete the ir program and maintain exercise after 
completion (Daly et al., 2002; S. M. Moore et al., 2003 ). Barriers to participation in cardiac rehabilitation 
programs in Canada include perceptions of not needing programs, work or time conflicts , and healthcare 
system factors such as wait times  (de Melo Ghisi et al., 2013) . Similar barriers  (such as denial of severity 
of illness, financial or occupational constrain ts, and healthcare system factors ) are experienced in other 
countries  (Clark et al., 2012; Cooper et al., 2002; Neubeck et al., 2012) .  
Santiago de Araújo Pio et al.  (Santiago de Araújo Pio et al., 2019)  synth esized the evidence on 
the effectiveness of interventions to increase participation . Included interventions were varied and 
comprised multiple components. Compared to usual care, interventions improved enrolment, 
adherence, and completion. However, this ev idence was judged to be of low to moderate quality. The 
authors concluded that the heterogeneity between studies and lack of understanding of underlying 
INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTING CARDIAC REHABILITATION  5 
 
mechanisms limit ed the informativeness of the evidence . They recommended that further 
research rigorously evaluat e interventions that target patient‐identified barriers, examin e how 
interventions work, and identify ‘active ingredients’ (Santiago de Araújo Pio et al., 2019) . 
We conducted a multicentre, pragmatic, three -arm randomised controlled trial to evaluate two 
interventions to improve c ardiac rehabilitation completion post -MI (Interventions Supporting Long -term 
Adherence aNd Decreasing cardiovascular events: ISLAND) (N. M. Ivers et al., in press, 2017) . The trial 
took place in nine cardi ac care centres and all eligible patients were enrolled. Participants were 
randomized to: i) usual care (no standardized follow up interventions; herein referred to as the usual 
care arm); ii) usual care plus a series of mailouts designed to target factors  influencing adherence, 
including a letter and pre -filled cardiac rehabilitation referral form for the patient to bring to their family 
physician (herein referred to as the mailouts only arm); or iii) usual care plus the series of mailouts, plus 
automated reminder telephone calls to identify those at risk of nonadherence, followed by additional 
support and navigation via trained lay health worker calls for such participants (herein referred to as the 
mailouts+calls arm).  The trial had two co -primary outcomes – adherence to cardiac medications, and 
cardiac rehabilitation completion – both measures of adherence to guideline -recommended treatments 
(CACPR, 2009; NICE, 2013; O’Gara et al., 2013) . 
While randomised trials ar e essential for evaluating whether behaviour change interventions 
work or not (causal description), further work is typically required to establish the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of 
intervention effectiveness (causal explanation). A process evaluation is a type of st udy which “aims to 
understand the functioning of an intervention, by examining implementation, mechanisms of impact, 
and contextual factors” (G. F. Moore et al., 2015) . We conducted  a theory -based process evaluation 
alongside the trial to investigate  the mechanisms of action of the interventions.  
The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) (Schwarzer, 2008; Schwarzer et al., 2011)  informed 
intervention design. HAPA proposes that health behaviour is influenced by a series of determinants in 
INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTING CARDIAC REHABILITATION  6 
 
two phases. In the motivat ional phase, an individual forms an intention to engage in the behaviour, 
which is influenced by: i) their perceptions of their risk of experiencing health events related to the 
behaviour (risk perception); ii) what they expect the outcomes of enacting the  behaviour might be 
(outcome expectancies); iii) their confidence in their ability to enact the behaviour (self -efficacy); and iv) 
specific barriers and resources, such as social support (Schwarzer, 2008; Schwarzer et al., 2011) . In the 
volitional phase, an individual’s  enactment of the behaviour is influenced by: i) their intention; ii) their 
self-efficacy; and iii) specific barriers and resources . The theory proposes that the influence of intention 
on behaviour is mediated (i.e. translated into action) via the individual’s development of plan s specifying 
when, where, and how they will enact the behaviour (action planning) ; and how they will overcome 
barriers they may face (coping planning) (Schwarzer, 2008; Schwarzer et al., 2011) . Action control (the 
processes by which an in dividual evaluates their enactment of the behaviour as compared to a standard) 
is also important for continuous or repeated enactment (Schwarzer, 2008; Schwarzer et al., 2011) . 
In our preparatory work, we found that HAPA constructs predicted medication adherence in this  
population (another behaviour of focus in the trial) (Presseau et al., 2017) . Wider literature shows that 
HAPA constructs also predict adherence with cardiac rehabilitation exercise (Schwarzer et al., 2008; 
Sniehotta et al., 2005, 2010) . HAPA constructs were therefore targeted as intervention mechanisms of 
action in the ISLAND trial. In addition, there have been calls in the behaviour change literature to move 
away from fo cusing on only one behaviour at a time and towards incorporating a multiple behaviour 
approach , which may achieve greater impact since health outcomes tend to be influenced by multiple 
health behaviours  (Nigg  et al., 2002; Presseau et al., 2015) . This is especially important given that cardiac 
rehabilitation exercise must be incorporated into everyday life, in which participants are already 
engaging in multiple health behaviours which either facilitate or conflict with rehabilitation -related goals 
(Presseau et al., 2015) . We incorporated this perspective by investigating  the impact of the interventions 
on the prioritization of cardiac rehabilitation exercises relative to participants’ other everyday life 
INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTING CARDIAC REHABILITATION  7 
 
behaviours (goal priority). The aim of this process evaluation was to investigate indirect effects of the 
interventions on cardiac rehabilitation adherence via theory -based cons tructs targeted.  In line with the 
phases of the HAPA  and the addition of goal priority  previously outlined , we hypothesised that 
compared to usual care, both interventions would  
i) increase participants’ intention to participate in cardiac rehabilitation exer cises by 
increasing their risk perceptions, positive outcome expectancies, self -efficacy, social 
support, and the priority of participating compared to other activities; and  
ii) increase participants’  likelihood of  completing cardiac rehabilitation by increasing 
intention, self -efficacy, social support, action planning, and coping planning.

Theory -based quantitative process evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial.  
 
Ethical approvals  
Ethical approval for the trial was provided by the nine cardiac centers involved (Hamilton 
General Hospital, Kingston General Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre, Peterborough Regional 
Health Care, St Catharines General Hospital, Sun nybrook Health Sciences Centre, Trillium Health 
Partners, University Health Network, and William Osler Health Centre). Given the low -risk nature of the 
intervention, research ethics boards approved a waiver of consent for patients enrolled in the trial wit h 
provision of multiple opportunities to opt out and a debrief at the time of outcome assessment. Ethics 
approval for the analyses reported here was granted by the Women’s College Hospital Research Ethics 
Board (#2017 -0135 -E), and the Ottawa Health Science  Network Research Ethics Board (#20170832 -01H).

Full d etails of the intervention development process have been published (Wittem an et al., 2017) , 
including the embedded Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs)  (Michie et al., 2013)  mapped to the 
theoretical constructs targeted, and the final series of mailouts used. Table 1 lists the underlying 
constructs assessed as mechanisms of change in this process evaluation, the BCTs used to target those 
constructs, and examples of how these BCTs were operationalized .  
TABLE 1 HERE  
Participants  
When outcome data for the trial were gathered at 12 months follow -up over the telephone, 
participants were invited to take part in the process evaluation. Participants were asked if they would be 
willing to answer a few more questions relating to their vie ws about participating in exercise and / or 
taking heart pills. As there were two co -primary outcomes in this trial, there were two process 
evaluation questionnaires. We recognised that completing all questionnaires may have been 
burdensome for participant s, and may also have impacted the accuracy and completeness of the 
responses received. Therefore, participants were initially invited to complete one of the process 
evaluation questionnaires (randomly assigned), and then once completed, were asked if they would be 
willing to complete a second questionnaire .  
The target sample size was 500 participants for each co -primary outcome , calculated based on 
testing the effect of a continuous mediator in a logistic regression model (Vittinghoff et al., 2009) . We 
assumed that the overall prevalence of cardiac rehabilitation completion at the end of the study would 
be 0.4; we also assumed a partial correlation between the mediator and each treatment indicator of 0.5 
and a standard deviation for the mediator of 1. With these assumptions, 500 participants achieve 80% 
power at a two -sided 5% significance level to detect an Odds Ratio for the mediator of 1.34, i.e., a 
relative increase of 34% in the odds of completing cardiac rehabilita tion per 1 -unit change in the 
INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTING CARDIAC REHABILITATION  9 
 
mediator. Participants were consecutively invited to take part in the process evaluation until the target 
sample size had been met. Participants were offered entry into a raffle to win one of five $20 gift cards.  
Data collecti on 
Completion of cardiac rehabilitation in the past year was assessed via self -report at 12 months 
and categorized as a binary outcome. Questions were validated in a previous study in Ontario which 
found almost perfect agreement between self -reported and site -verified use of cardiac rehabilitation 
services (Kayaniyil et al., 2009) . Participants in our study were first asked if they had attended even one 
session of cardiac rehabilita tion in the past year; if they reported that they had, they were then asked 
whether they fully participated in the program, including the final re -assessment of heart health at the 
end of the program; if participants reported not completing the program, th ey were asked to estimate 
the proportion of total scheduled sessions attended. In line with consensus -derived data definitions  
(Grace, Poirier, et al., 2014) , those  reporting multiple visits and re-assessment  were considered to have 
completed cardiac rehabilitation.   
Process evaluation questionnaires were also administered over the telephone at 12 months. The 
questionnaire included items assessing the HAPA constructs, based on previously validated scales. A 
new item was included to assess goal priority. Exercise is the key focus of cardiac rehabilitation, and 
participants could have been at various stages of program completion when responding (with some 
potentially having not attended any sessions). For p articipants who had attended at least one 
rehabilitation session, questions were phrased in relation to partic ipating in cardiac rehabilitation 
exercises. For participants who had not attended at least one session, questions were phrased in 
relation to participating in exercise to stay fit. Details of the constructs assessed are presented in Table 
2. All questions  (those used in the outcome evaluation and process evaluation) are included in the  
Online Supplemental Materials . 
INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTING CARDIAC REHABILITATION  10 
 
Participant socio -demographic and clinical characteristics were gathered for the trial from 
administrative sources. A provincial cardiac regis try, hosted by CorHealth Ontario (previously Cardiac 
Care Network), with data collected by each cardiac centre, along with patient -reported data were linked 
to the population -level health administrative databases held at ICES (an Ontario -based health 
infor matics research institute). Demographic data collected via administrative sources comprised age, 
sex, smoking status, education, ethnicity, rurality, and socioeconomic status (neighbourhood income 
quintile estimate) (Statistics Canada,  Government of Canada, 2017) . Additional demographic data 
collected as part of the outcome assessment questionnaire for the main trial comprised immigration 
status, marital status, prior cardiac event or procedure, and whether the participant had diabet es. 
Data processing and analysis  
Participants were excluded from analyses if they did not have a value for at least 50% of the 
items for 50% (4/8) of the constructs. For the theoretical constructs assessed using multiple items, we 
assessed internal consist ency using Cronbach’s alpha (Table 2). If internal consistency was <0.7, we 
explored whether consistency could be improved by omitting individual items. We calculated the mean 
of the items measuring each construct to create a summary score. Mean scores for  constructs were 
calculated using the data available, and analyses were conducted using pairwise deletion. Differences 
between trial arms were assessed using one -way ANOVA with post -hoc Tukey tests to further 
investigate any observed differences.  
TABLE 2 HERE  
We investigated indirect associations between the interventions and completion via the 
constructs assessed. Models were built using Hayes’ SPSS PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2013) , using the 
bootstrapping procedure with 5000 resamples. Consistent with HAPA’s two phases, we built one model 
to investigate indirect effects of the interventions on intention via motivational constructs, and a second 
model to investigate effects on rehab ilitation completion via volitional constructs. All analyses were 
INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTING CARDIAC REHABILITATION  11 
 
conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 25. All analyses were conducted, and subsequent interpretations 
made, before knowledge of the final trial results was obtained.  
Results  
Summary of the ISLAND trial results  
Compared to usual care, mailouts+calls resulted in a significantly greater proportion of patients 
completing cardiac rehabilitation (N. M. Ivers et al., in press) . There was no significant difference 
between usual care and mailouts only in cardiac rehabilitation completion (N. M. Ivers et al., in press) .  
Process evaluation response rates and participant characteristics  
Participant flow through the process evaluation is summarized in Figure  1. In total, 2742 
patients were enrolled in the trial; 2632 were included in trial analyses. Of these, 1566 were invited to  
the process evaluation; 1162 (74%) consented. Details of participants’ reasons for declining to 
participate were not gathered. Of the 1162 , 594 responded to the cardiac rehabilitation completion 
questionnaire (589 responded to the medication adherence questionnaire not included in this 
manuscript, with 21 responding to both); 588 (99%) were included in our analyses (6 were excluded du e 
to the volume of missing data); 214 (36%) in the usual care arm, 187 (32%) in the mailouts only arm, and 
187 (32%) in the mailouts+calls arm. This fulfilled our target sample size of 167 participants per arm.  
FIGURE 1 HERE  
Participant characteristics are summarized in Table 3. On average, participants in each arm were 
63-64 years old, and most were male (74 -75%). Within each arm, there was spread across categories of 
socioeconomic status and extent of education.  
TABLE 3 HERE 
Intervention effects on constructs  
Results of internal consistency analyses are included in Table 2. The threshold of 0.7 was not 
met for risk perception or social support. The two items assessing risk perception were analysed as 
INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTING CARDIAC REHABILITATION  12 
 
separate items. The Cron bach’s alpha value could not be improved for social support by omitting any of 
the three items: therefore, all items were included but interpreted with due caution.  
Mean scores, and differences between arms, are shown in Table 4. Between -group differences 
were found for severity risk perception, self -efficacy, action planning, and coping planning. Post -hoc 
Tukey tests indicated that: i) untreated coronary health problems were viewed as less severe in the 
mailouts+calls arm than the usual care arm ( p=.001),  and in the mailouts+calls arm than the mailouts 
only arm ( p<.001); ii) self -efficacy for exercise participation despite potential barriers was higher in the 
mailouts+calls arm than the usual care arm ( p=.006); iii) action planning for participation in exe rcises 
was greater in the mailouts+calls arm than the usual care arm ( p=.020); and iv) coping planning for 
participation in exercises was greater in the mailouts+calls arm than the usual care arm ( p<.001).  
TABLE 4 HERE  
Indirect effects of interventions on intention to participate in cardiac rehabilitation exercises  
We identified significant positive indirect effects of the mailouts+calls intervention on intention 
to participate in cardiac rehabilitation exercises via increased priority, positive outcome ex pectancies, 
and self -efficacy (Figure 2). Controlling for all other variables: relative to the control group, the intention 
scores of those who received the mailouts+calls were on average 0.06 units higher  (95%CI 0.01 to 0.12) 
due to the impact of this intervention on priority; 0.04 units higher  (95%CI 0.01 to 0.09) due to the 
impact of this intervention on positive outcome expectancies; and 0.10 units higher  (95%CI 0.04 to 0.18) 
due to the impact of this intervention on self -efficacy.    
However, this was mitigated by a negative indirect effect via severity risk perception (i.e. 
reduced severity with which untreated coronary health problems were viewed).  Controlling for all other 
variables: relative to the control group, the intention s cores of those who received the mailouts+calls 
were on average 0.02 units lower (95%CI -0.06 to -0.01) due to the impact of this intervention on 
severity risk perception. There were no significant indirect effects of mailouts only (Figure 2).  
INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTING CARDIAC REHABILITATION  13 
 
FIGURE 2 HER E 
Indirect effects of interventions on exercise -based cardiac rehabilitation completion  
Cardiac rehabilitation completion was defined as participating in the full program, including the 
final re -assessment of heart health at the end of the program. Self-reported rehabilitation completion 
rates for process evaluation participants were as follows: 34.1% (73/214) in the usual care arm; 40.1% 
(75/187) in the mailouts only arm; and 41.7% (78/187) in the mailouts+calls arm. Pearson Chi -squared 
tests indica ted that among the 1,773 individuals with a non -missing response for cardiac rehabilitation 
completion, those whose data were analysed as part of either process evaluation (n=1,152) were more 
likely to complete rehabilitation than those who did not take pa rt in the process evaluation (those not 
asked to participate, as well as those asked but who declined) (n = 621) in the usual care arm 
(2(1)=19.6, p<.001),  mailouts only arm (2(1)=30.9 p<.001),  and the mailouts+calls arm (2(1)=13.0, 
p<.001) . 
We identified significant positive indirect effects of the mailouts+calls on cardiac rehabilitation 
completion via increased self -efficacy and action planning (Figure 3).  Controlling for all other variables: 
relative to the control group, the odds of completi ng rehabilitation in those who received the 
mailouts+calls were on average 1.13 times greater (95%CI 1.04 to 1.30) due to the impact of this 
intervention on self -efficacy, and 1.08 times greater (95%CI 1.02 to 1.20) due to the impact of this 
intervention o n action planning.  There were no significant indirect effects of mailouts only (Figure 3).  
FIGURE 3 HERE  
Discussion  
Embedded within a randomized trial, we conducted a theory -based quantitative process 
evaluation to investigate the mechanisms of action of two interventions designed to support completion 
of exercise -based cardiac rehabilitation. Compared to usual care, th e intervention comprising a series of 
mailouts alone had no indirect effect on either intention to participate in exercises, or completion of 
INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTING CARDIAC REHABILITATION  14 
 
cardiac rehabilitation (assessed via self -report) via proposed mechanisms (goal priority, outcome 
expectancies, ri sk perception, self -efficacy, social support, action planning, coping planning). However, 
the intervention comprising the mailouts plus additional telephone support had indirect effects on 
intention via increased priority of participating in exercise compa red to other activities; increased 
positive outcome expectancies related to participating; and increased self-efficacy  in participating in 
exercise despite potential barriers. Of note, this intervention also had an unintended negative effect in 
that it red uced the severity with which untreated coronary health problems were viewed (risk 
perceptions). This intervention al so had indirect effects on self-reported cardiac rehabilitation 
completion via increased self -efficacy and increased action -planning (develo pment of a detailed plan 
specifying when, where, and how they would participate in exercise).  
Implications for interpreting intervention effectiveness  
Although effect sizes are small and we cannot infer causality, o ur findings suggest that the 
mailouts+calls intervention improved cardiac rehabilitation completion by enhancing participants’ self -
efficacy and action -planning. Five interventions included in the recent Cochrane review of interventions 
to increase partici pation in cardiac rehabilitation  (Santiago de Araújo Pio et al., 2019)  were explicitly 
based on Social Cognitive Theory or exercise self -efficacy (D. L. Carroll et al., 2007; Dolansky et al., 2011; 
Focht et al., 2004; Pfaeffli Dale et al., 2015; Price, 2012) . In two further studies which considered self -
efficacy , interventions were designed to support maintenance of exercise following a rehabilitation 
program (Izawa et al., 2005; S. M. Moore et al., 2006) . Six of the se seven  interventions improved 
rehabilitation utilization or exercise maintenance (D. L. Carroll et al., 2007; Dolansky et al., 2011; Focht 
et al., 2004; Izawa et al., 2005; S. M. Moore et al., 2006; Price, 2012) , indicating the potential of these 
interventions. Self -efficacy was measured in four of the six studies (Dolansky et al., 2011; Izawa et al., 
2005; S. M. Moore et al., 2006; Price, 2012) : a significant increase in self -efficacy was found in only one 
(Izawa et al., 2005) . Previous studies did not involve exploration of indirect effects. Our results advance 
INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTING CARDIAC REHABILITATION  15 
 
the understanding of effective intervention components by  highlighting  self-efficacy as a potential 
mechanism of effect.  
The importance of planning in this population has been highlighted. Sniehotta et al.  (Sniehotta 
et al., 2006)  found that although ac tion planning alone had no significant effect, it led to higher levels of 
physical activity in combination with coping planning . Sniehotta et al.  (Sniehotta et al., 2006)  suggested 
that action planning may have been less effective than combined planning because participants may 
have already formed acti on plans prior to the intervention . Following this line of reasoning, participants 
in our study may not have already formed action plans and therefore benefitted from reminders and 
support to do so. However, it is important to highlight the small effect si ze and to note that mean scores 
for action planning and coping planning were still relatively low in this group (2.74 and 2.72 
respectively). A narrative synthesis conducted within a systematic review of coping planning 
interventions suggested that these interventions work better when planning is supported by someone 
(Kwasnicka et al., 2013) . Participants in our study may have benefitted from more support to develop 
both their action and coping plans. Combined with previous literature (Schwarzer et al., 2008; Sniehotta 
et al., 2010) , our results highlight the potential impact of these relatively straightforward, personalized, 
scalable interventions.  
The mailouts+calls  also impacted  participants’ motivation. A novel finding was that th is 
intervention increased the priority of these exercises relative to other behaviours of everyday life. 
Previous work in non -clinical populations indicated that increasing the priority of physical activity 
strengthens the influence of intention on physical activity behaviour (Conner et al., 2016) . Ours is the 
first study to indicate t he value of considering goal priority for intervention development with clinical 
populations, thereby reinforcing the importance of taking a multiple behaviour perspective when 
developing behaviour change interventions (Nigg et al., 2002; Presseau et al., 2015) . 
INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTING CARDIAC REHABILITATION  16 
 
However, there was also a negative effect on severity risk perceptions. During intervention 
development, patients reviewing mail -out materials noted that the included health risk information was 
potentially frightening (Witteman et al., 2017) . The team acknowledged that this was worrisome, but 
agreed that they had an ethical imperative to convey this information (Witteman et al., 2017) . Although 
this does not seem to have been an issue for the group receivin g the mailouts only, the likelihood of 
participants being frightened may have been increased for the group receiving the calls , which were 
aimed at individuals at risk of non -adherence and frequently emphasized that adhering to treatments 
could reduce the risk of a further heart attack. This may have elicited defensive reactions, resulting in 
the perceptions of reduced seriousness of untreated coronary health problems (Ditto et al., 1988) . 
Alternatively, the reassurance and support provided in the calls may have reduced some concerns about 
risks in general , which may have contributed to the lower scores for this item in this group. In any case, 
risk perception is conceptualized as a distal  predictor of behaviour (Schwarzer, 2008; Schwarzer et al., 
2011)  and therefore according to the underlying theory, this negative effect is unlikely to have had a 
great deal of impact on cardiac rehabilitation completion in the trial. That said, this finding highlights a 
general strength of conducting mechanistic process evaluations, in that this has enabled us to identify 
unintended consequences of the intervention that we may not have discovered otherwise . This can 
inform subsequent iterations of intervention content.  
Although both interventions were developed to include the same active ingredients (i.e. the 
same BCTs), they differentially effected the proposed mechanisms, and neither influenced all proposed 
mechanisms. There are several potential explanations for this.  First, the differences could be related to 
BCT operationalization. BCTs can be operationalized in various ways; there are no standardized 
methods. It may be that in the intervention comprising mailouts alone, which did not influence 
underlying mechanisms,  the chosen BCTs were not operationalized in the most appropriate way for 
targeting the proposed mechanisms. A related but separate possibility is that the differences are related 
INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTING CARDIAC REHABILITATION  17 
 
to differences in dose or intensity of BCT delivery  (the amount of the speci fic active component included 
in the overall intervention (Hoffmann et al., 2014) ). Given that the same BCTs were repeated, the 
mailouts+calls contained a higher dose (repetition) of the same BCTs as those included in the mailouts 
only. A third potential explanation relates to mode  of delivery: discussions over the phone with another 
person may have been more powerful than paper format only. Finally, the additional phone calls may 
have enhanced intervention fidelity (the degree to which an intervention is applied as intended (C. 
Carroll et al., 2007) )by encouraging or reminding participants to read and use the mailouts.  
Strengths and limitations  
This study demonstrates the value of applying contemporary behaviour change theory to 
develop and evaluate interventions alongside randomized trials in health care. Validated measures were 
used to assess theoretical constructs where available. We identifie d potential mechanisms of effect of 
one intervention, and  proposed multiple possible explanations for the lack of effects of the other 
intervention. The response rate to the overall process evaluation study was reasonable (74%), and 
exclusions from analyse s were kept to a minimum: only six participants were excluded from all analyses, 
and the lowest number of participants in an analysis was 548 of a possible 594 (92%).  
However, there are some key limitations to note. The behavioural outcome (cardiac 
rehabi litation completion) was self -reported, which may lead to inaccuracies in reporting or increase the 
likelihood of socially desirable responding. However, there was not uniform reporting of high adherence 
as may be expected. In addition, the items we used w ere validated in a previous study in our province 
which indicated that self -reported rates of cardiac rehabilitation participation are concordant with 
program -reported rates (Kayaniyil et al., 2009) . Our approach to handling missing data was not based on 
a precedent in the literature but reflected our aim to use as much of the gathered data as possible in our 
analyses. The theoretical constructs and outcome were assessed at the same time, which limits the 
interpretation of causality in the  analyses of indirect effects.  Given this design, we cannot rule out the 
INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTING CARDIAC REHABILITATION  18 
 
possibility that attending cardiac rehabilitation contributed to the increase in mean scores for constructs 
seen in the mailouts+calls intervention group. However, while rehabilitatio n completion rates were 
similar for both intervention groups, only the mailouts+calls group showed indirect effects via self -
efficacy which suggests that this intervention  likely had an effect on self -efficacy over -and-above cardiac 
rehabilitation attendan ce per se. While the pragmatic nature of this trial precluded this option, future 
research should aim to decouple and sequence mediator and outcome assessment over time where 
possible . In addition, the wording of theoretical construct questions varied for participants who had not 
attended a session of cardiac rehabilitation (focussing on conducting exercise in general as opposed to 
conducting exercises learned at rehabilitation). We were unable to control for this in our analyses due to 
questionnaire wordin g being directly linked to  the outcome (cardiac rehabilitation completion).  This 
constitutes a risk of bias in our findings. However, there were no significant differences across groups in 
the proportion of participants who  completed the two different versions of the questionnaire 
(2(2)=1.570, p=.456) . Although  this makes it less likely that questionnaire wording  would account for 
the differences in indirect effects observed between the groups , it does not eliminate this ri sk of bias . 
Future research should avoid this risk,  for example by using wording referring to exercise in general for 
all participants.  
There was an imbalance of sex in our participant group, with most participants being male. 
However, the majority of indi viduals diagnosed with MI in the general population are male (Albrektsen 
et al., 2016; Public Health Agency of Canada, 2018) . Trial results demonstrated that intervention effects 
on cardiac rehabilitation completion did not differ depending on any sociodemographic characteristics, 
including sex (N. M. Ivers et al., in press) . The analyses reported here were not powered to include 
moderator effects. Eff ect modification on constructs hypothesised as underlying mechanisms of change, 
and the impact of tailoring interventions based on sociodemographic characteristics such as sex, could 
be explored in further research . Although the effect sizes found for the mailouts+calls are small, such 
INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTING CARDIAC REHABILITATION  19 
 
effects were achieved in the context of a pragmatic trial introducing a feasible, minimally -invasive 
intervention delivered at scale as part of routine care, indicating the potential for scalability and impact 
at a population  level. We found differences in cardiac rehabilitation completion in the sub -set of 
participants who took part in the process evaluation compared to those in the trial who did not, which 
may call into question the generalisability of our findings. However,  differences were found in both 
intervention arms as well as the control arm, indicating that some trial participants were less likely to 
adhere to cardiac rehabilitation whether or not they received one of the interventions. It is likely that 
this group o f participants faced challenges with cardiac rehabilitation completion different to those 
addressed by the interventions evaluated in this study, and therefore require different types of 
additional supports.  
Suggestions for future development and evaluati on of interventions  
Our results indicate that those  developing interventions to facilitate cardiac rehabilitation 
completion should consider targeting goal priority, outcome expectancies, self -efficacy, and action 
planning , while mitigating negative effects  on risk perceptions . Since the mailouts+calls improved  
cardiac rehabilitation completion  in the overall trial, the pragmatic nature of the project would suggest 
that scale and spread of this intervention are key next steps. Our findings in dicate  that the positive 
effects of th is intervention may be optimized if it is refined beforehand , for example, by re-visiting the 
content targeting risk perceptions, and reinforc ing the content targeting action planning. In addition, 
future work should e valuate impacts using objective reports of program completion where possible and 
feasible. Although we proposed several reasons why mailouts only did not influence theoretical 
constructs, we cannot definitively say why this occurred: future research could explore  the effects of 
different BCT operationalizations, methods of delivery, dose/intensity, and assessments of fidelity.  
Conclusion s 
INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTING CARDIAC REHABILITATION  20 
 
Our theory -based process evaluation conducted alongside a pragmatic randomised trial 
indicates that an intervention comprising a series of theory -informed mailouts plus additional telephone 
support increased the likelihood of completing cardiac rehabilitat ion (assessed via self -report) by 
increasing participants’ confidence in participating in exercise despite potential barriers (self -efficacy), 
and by encouraging participants to develop a detailed plan specifying when, where, and how they would 
participate  in exercise (action -planning). An intervention comprising the mailouts alone did not 
influence hypothesised mechanisms of action. Our findings, coupled with the clear delineation of the 
specific behaviour change techniques included in the interventions in  previous publications, may serve 
as a roadmap for researchers and practitioners wishing to translate this work into other settings .
