Abstract
Background: The Clinical Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Work-related Mental Health Conditions
in General Practice (the Guideline) was published in 2019. The objective of this trial is to implement the Guideline
in general practice.
Trial design: Implementing work-related Mental health conditions in general PRacticE is a hybrid III, parallel cluster
randomised controlled trial undertaken in Australia. Its primary aim is to assess the effectiveness of a complex
intervention on the implementation of the Guideline in general practice. Secondary aims are to assess patient
health and work outcomes, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the trial, and to develop a plan for sustainability.
Methods: A total of 86 GP clusters will be randomly allocated either to the intervention arm, where they will
receive a complex intervention comprising academic detailing, enrolment in a community of practice and
resources, or to the control arm, where they will not receive the intervention. GP guideline concordance will be
assessed at baseline and 9 months using virtual simulated patient scenarios. Patients who meet the eligibility
criteria (>18years, employed, and receiving care from a participating GP for a suspected or confirmed work-related
mental health condition) will be invited to complete surveys about their health and work participation and provide
access to their health service use data. Data on health service use and work participation compensation claim data
will be combined with measures of guideline concordance and patient outcomes to inform an economic
evaluation. A realist evaluation will be conducted to inform the development of a plan for sustainability.
Results: We anticipate that GPs who receive the intervention will have higher guideline concordance than GPs in
the control group. We also anticipate that higher concordance will translate to better health and return-to-work
outcomes for patients, as well as cost-savings to society.
Conclusions: The trial builds on a body of work defining the role of GPs in compensable injury, exploring their
concerns, and developing evidence-based guidelines to address them. Implementation of these guidelines has the
potential to deliver improvements in GP care, patient health, and return-to-work outcomes.

Background
Mental health conditions that have arisen as a result of
work factors (henceforth referred to as work-related
mental health conditions) are one of the most challen-
ging injuries to manage [ 1,2]. These conditions can re-
sult in some of the most expensive and complex claims
and afflicted patients can take three times longer to re-
turn to work compared with the median time for all
claims [ 3].
GPs play a key role in the diagnosis, treatment, and
care of patients with work-related injuries. They are per-
ceived as one of the most trusted sources of advice for
patients, considered by patients and other health profes-
sionals to be the primary coordinator of patient care,
and are often tasked with advocating to employers on
the patient ’s behalf [ 2,4,5]. Yet, many GPs, internation-
ally, describe substantial challenges in providing this
care, particularly where the injury involves a mental
health condition [ 4–9]. For instance, GPs describe diffi-
culty diagnosing mental health conditions and determin-
ing the work-relatedness of a mental health condition,
navigating system complexities, coordinating clinical
care, communicating with workplaces, concern about
imposing further harm on the patient (for instance con-
cern about the patient facing stigma at work if they are
known to have a work-related mental health condition),
and a lack of evidence about optimal clinical practice [ 5,
8,10,11]. That similar challenges are described inter-
nationally underscores that across the compensable in-
jury landscape, patients with mental health conditionsthat have arisen from work are seen as difficult to man-
age, and that GPs are fundamental to brokering im-
proved health and employment outcomes for such
patients. The nature of these challenges suggests that
they can be overcome through interventions that im-
prove knowledge and offer GPs the opportunity to grow
their confidence and skills in providing care.
In 2019, an evidence-based clinical guideline titled
Clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of
work-related mental health conditions in general practice
was published [ 12]. This guideline is the only GP-
focused guideline on diagnosing and managing work-
related mental health conditions internationally. It was
developed according to the gold-standard for guideline
development in Australia —and approved by the National
Health and Medical Research Council —and is endorsed
by the two peak general practice membership organisa-
tions in Australia, the Royal Australian College of Gen-
eral Practitioners and the Australian College of Rural
and Remote Medicine. It addresses specific clinical di-
lemmas about the diagnosis and management of work-
related mental health conditions that have been raised
by GPs and other clinical and policy stakeholders [ 11,
13].
Despite the Guideline being available, it is widely
recognised that clinicians seldom consult clinical guide-
lines when making clinical decisions [ 14]. Instead, they
more often develop internalised, tacit protocols that are
based on collective reinforcement by peers, previous
clinical experiences, and, to a lesser extent, literature or
guidelines [ 14]. To effectively embed guideline-
concordant behaviour into practice, an intervention
would need to facilitate the development of new collect-
ively reinforced, internalised tacit beliefs that align with
the Guideline recommendations and overcome the con-
cerns described by GPs. These requirements align well
to the constructs of normalisation process theory: coher-
ence, cognitive participation, collective action, and re-
flexive monitoring [ 15]. Therefore, an intervention that
operationalizes normalisation process theory and re-
enforces the role of peers and opinion leaders [ 16,17]
may be effective at implementing the Guideline. Whilst
these factors ready a clinician for behaviour change, the
application, practice, and embedding of new practices
occurs over time and stages [ 18]. As such, a combination
of these elements may provide an effective and sustain-
able model for influencing guideline-concordant behav-
iour change in GPs.Mazza et al. Implementation Science           (2021) 16:77 Page 2 of 11
Two intervention approaches that encompass the prin-
ciples of normalisation process theory and the influence
of peers and opinion leaders are academic detailing and
communities of practice. These interventions have some
success in changing GP behaviour when offered indi-
vidually [ 19–22], but are more effective when offered to-
gether [ 19,23]. Academic detailing involves peer-to-peer
delivery of evidence-based key messages that are tailored
to the needs of participating clinicians [ 20,21,23]. Aca-
demic detailing has been used regularly to educate clini-
cians and facilitate evidence-based practice [ 24].
Additionally, a community of practice involves driving
innovation and excellence through sustained interaction
over a period of time [ 22,25]. Communities of practices
have been used successfully in Australia to improve
evidence-based care and communication skills in general
practice [ 26]. They provide support for practitioners
who can feel isolated in dealing with clinical problems,
helping them to create networks and implement new
models of care [ 27]. A third approach, the provision of
resources to support guideline implementation, is also
more effective when combined with peer-to-peer strat-
egies [ 28].
Our complex intervention combines these academic
detailing a community of practice and the provision
of resources and is expected to facilitate guideline im-
plementation by introducing these in a staged manner
to facilitate guideline-concordant practice over time
(Figure 1). It will do so in the following ways: (a) ad-
dressing professional isolation; (b) learning fromrespected peers; (c) enabling GPs to demonstrate their
own leadership by assisting their peers; (d) enabling
GPs to develop confidence in their plan of action be-
fore consulting with the patient, or stakeholder in-
volved in the patient ’s care; and (e) providing this
interaction in a flexible environment that caters to
the GP ’s resource availability (e.g. time, mode of
communication).
Research hypothesis
Our primary hypothesis is that exposure to a complex
intervention consisting of academic detailing, and
provision of resources and engagement in a digital com-
munity of practice will increase the delivery of guideline-
concordant care by GPs to patients regarding the diag-
nosis and management of work-related mental health
conditions. We hypothesise that increases in guideline-
concordant care will translate into improvements in
health status and work productivity, and reductions in
health service utilisation.
Aims
This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a complex
intervention involving academic detailing, provision of
resources, and engagement in a digital community of
practice on the implementation of evidence-based guide-
lines for the diagnosis and management of work-related
mental health conditions in general practice. Our sec-
ondary aims are to (a) improve the health and return-to-
work outcomes for patients with work-related mental

health conditions in this study, (b) evaluate the cost-
effectiveness of the guideline implementation strategy,
and (c) develop an implementation plan for
sustainability.
Methods
Design
Implementing work-related Mental health conditions in
general PRacticE (IMPRovE) is a hybrid III parallel
cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a complex
intervention that involves receipt of academic detailing,
enrolment onto a digital community of practice, and
access to a library of resources to support guideline im-
plementation. GP clinics (clusters) will be randomised
to either intervention or control. A cluster design was
chosen to avoid confounding that could arise if partici-
pating GPs from a single clinic were allocated to differ-
ent arms of the trial. Participating GPs in clinics
assigned to the intervention arm will receive the inter-
vention. GPs in the control arm will not receive the
intervention. Patients will be recruited to each arm
(Figure 2).
As a hybrid III trial [ 29], the primary outcome of the
trial will demonstrate the effectiveness of this complex
intervention to improve guideline concordance by GPs.
The secondary outcomes of the trial will demonstrative
the effectiveness of the complex intervention on patient
heath status and cost-effectiveness. Lastly, we will review
the likelihood of this intervention being sustained and
develop a plan for sustainability. This protocol has been
reported according to the Template for Intervention De-
scription and Replication (TIDieR) checklist [ 30] and the
CONSORT extension for Cluster Trials [ 31] (Additional
files 1and2, respectively).
Setting
The study will be conducted across all states and terri-
tories in Australia. Recruitment of GPs will occur from
December 2020 until December 2021 whilst recruitment
of patients will occur from February 2021 until Septem-
ber 2022 or the latest date representing nine-months
after the final GP provides baseline measures.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
General practitioners
GPs are eligible to participate if they can recruit 7 to 24
eligible patients over the course of the trial. GPs may
consent after their practice has already been randomised;
however, we will aim to enrol all GPs before their prac-
tice has been notified of their allocation. If a GP works
across multiple sites, then we will randomise both sites
together.Patients
Patients are eligible if they are 18 years or older, have a
confirmed or suspected work-related mental health con-
dition, are receiving care from a participating GP, and
are employed at the time of enrolment. Patients who are
employed but are not working (e.g. on paid or unpaid
leave) and those who have an active workers ’compensa-
tion claim are also eligible to participate in the study.
Participant recruitment
General practitioners
GPs meeting the minimum caseload requirements for
eligibility will be recruited through regional health au-
thorities (known as primary health networks), GP mem-
bership organisations, study partners, and other relevant
healthcare organisations using newsletters, website up-
dates, and social media avenues.
Patients
Patients will be recruited via the participating clinic
through advertisement in the clinic waiting room, adver-
tisement on the participating GP ’s desk, or directly
through the participating GP, who will identify eligible
patients and provide these patients with a printed infor-
mation pack about the study. The information pack will
include an explanatory statement, consent forms, and a
reply-paid envelope. In addition to seeking consent to
participate in data collection, consent will also be re-
quested from patients to access administrative records of
their health service utilisation for the purposes of an
economic evaluation. Patients who wish to participate in
the study will be invited to contact the IMPRovE project
team for further information or to return their com-
pleted consent forms directly to the team using the
reply-paid envelope.
Sample size
A sample size of 86 clinics (clusters), with a minimum of
one GP per cluster and assuming a GP dropout rate of
25%, has >80% power to detect a medium-large effect
size of Cohen ’s d of 0.69 (assuming a GP-level outcome
score change of 1.2 on a scale with score range of 0 to 9
and a standard deviation of 1.75 as identified in a pilot
study of the primary outcome tool; correlation between
baseline and follow-up measurements of 0.3, and two-
sided significance of 0.05).
We estimate that each GP cluster will recruit a mini-
mum of 7 and a maximum of 24 patients (the cut-off to
ensure that the patient sample is not skewed by a high-
recruiting cluster) over the study period. Based on our
analysis of high-caseload GPs [ 32], we estimate that
there will be approximately 22 eligible patients/year/GP.
Accounting for a 66% estimated rate of refusal to partici-
pate as observed in another study that recruitedMazza et al. Implementation Science           (2021) 16:77 Page 4 of 11
participants with mental health conditions in the Austra-
lian general practice setting [ 33], we estimate that at
least 7 eligible patients will be successfully recruited by
each participating GP in a 9-month period.
We anticipate that approximately 448 patients who
are recruited within the 9 months (224 from control
clinics and 224 test clinics; 7 per clinic/cluster) will
have 3-month data. These patient numbers assume upto 25% of the 86 recruited GPs will drop out of the
study. Using data from these patients, we will have 90%
power to detect medium effects (Cohen ’sd=0 . 5 )i n
secondary outcome measures between two groups
(test/control) at 3 months. Calculations assume an
alpha of 0.01, ICC of 0.03, and correlation of 0.5 be-
tween individual scores. Calculations were made using
Cluster statistical software [ 34].

Randomisation
A statistician who will not be involved in recruitment
and will be blinded to the identity of participating GPs
will allocate GP clusters to either the intervention or the
control arm. Randomisation will be performed as strati-
fied randomisation using a minimization procedure.
Stratification factors are state, clinic size (GP equivalent
full time >5 (yes/no)), and location (urban vs regional/
rural). We will randomise clinics in blocks of two, or
every 2 weeks, whichever occurs first.
Intervention
Intervention components
The intervention components have been co-designed by
the research team, an Intervention Advisory Group com-
prising policy and practice representatives, and a key
non-government mental health organisation Beyond
Blue and piloted by a GP reference group. A steering
group comprising key practice and policy representatives
from across Australia reviewed the intervention design
and provided advice to enhance its usability and sustain-
ability. This approach was used to ensure that GPs re-
ceive an intervention that is relevant to their clinical
practice as well as relevant to policy contexts.
Academic detailing will be provided in a single online
session using video-conferencing. The session will be led
by a GP opinion leader along with a professional aca-
demic detailer. GP opinion leaders are GPs having been
nominated by compensation scheme partners as these
GPs are well versed in the complexities of the workers ’
compensation system but are not representatives of the
compensation schemes themselves. Each GP opinion
leader will be supported by an experienced academic de-
tailer who has expertise in providing educational out-
reach programs to GPs. GPs from clusters in the
intervention arm of the trial will be detailed on how to
improve care for patients with work-related mental
health conditions in accordance with the guideline. The
format of each session will include (1) introduction to
the guideline and the provision of statistics about work-
related mental health conditions; (2) discussion of the
key challenges that are faced by attending GPs; and (3)
discussion of a case study with advice and instruction on
how to implement guideline-concordant care. During
the academic detailing session, opinion leaders will invite
GPs to join the digital community of practice, enrol
them as members of this community, and provide a
demonstration on how to navigate and use the digital
community of practice platform. Opinion leaders will
keep a log of the key challenges and issues reported by
GPs at each detailing session and this log will be used to
inform the content of the community of practice and
contribute to the process evaluation. To ensure fidelity
of the academic detailing, all academic detailing sessionswill be recorded. A random selection of 20% of sessions
will then be assessed against a pre-determined checklist,
adapted from Carroll et al. [ 35] for academic detailing
sessions, and a fidelity score will be reported. In
addition, a qualitative and quantitative fidelity assess-
ment will be used to assess the fidelity of the first five
academic detailing sessions and provide feedback to GP
opinion leaders on the delivery of these sessions.
The digital community of practice is an online plat-
form that will showcase the guideline recommendations
and provides avenues to discuss and support guideline
implementation strategies. A central component of the
platform will be a discussion forum. In addition, the
platform will offer a range of regular content in the form
of webinars, case discussions, and news. A content roster
and engagement protocol will also be used to facilitate
ongoing engagement. The content roster will be
reviewed quarterly to adjust for ongoing developments
in published educational materials or other resources,
and in response to GP engagement levels over the pre-
ceding quarter. Once GPs are enrolled into the digital
community of practice, they will continue to have access
to the community of practice for the duration of the trial
(until September 2022).
Participating GPs will be provided with resources in-
cluding the full guideline, flowchart of guideline recom-
mendations, and a checklist of clinical indicators that
was created by the expert Guideline Development Group
during development of the guideline. They will also be
supplied with resources from the compensation partners
and Beyond Blue , a prominent non-government mental
health organisation in Australia .
Control group
Participating GPs in clinics assigned to the control group
will receive no support for guideline implementation. At
the conclusion of the trial, GPs in the control group will
be invited to attend an academic detailing session and
engage in selected activities from the community of
practice.
Outcomes
Primary outcome
The primary outcome is concordance with guideline rec-
ommendations by participating GPs. Guideline concord-
ance will be assessed at baseline and 9 months later
using virtual simulated patient scenarios. At each data
collection point, GPs will be presented with three virtual
scenarios of varying levels of complexity and patient cir-
cumstance. The three virtual scenarios for each GP at
each data collection point will be randomly selected
from a set of eighteen virtual scenarios, controlling for
learning effects and order effects, and balancing rigorous
measurement with participation burden. We based theMazza et al. Implementation Science           (2021) 16:77 Page 6 of 11
development of these scenarios on 20 interviews with
patients who have lived experiences of work-related
mental health conditions to ensure that virtual scenarios
reflect the range of patient characteristics that a GP
would see.
This approach has been used previously to evaluate
practice and as an educational tool in compensable in-
jury research with GPs in Europe [ 36] and with physio-
therapists in Australia [ 37]. The virtual scenarios are
approximately 15 min duration each and focussed on
typical presentations to GPs by patients with work-
related mental health conditions. Each virtual scenario
includes a short video of a simulated patient who de-
scribes their symptoms, circumstances and context. Par-
ticipating GPs are then prompted to respond to
questions about how they would assess, diagnose, and
manage the patient in the virtual scenario.
Guideline-concordant responses to the scenarios will
be measured using a tool that reflects the checklist of in-
dicators that have been included in the Guideline.
Responding to each set of three virtual scenarios can re-
sult in a best score of 9 or a worst score of 0. The tool
was pilot tested with three groups: (1) GPs who are ex-
perts in the Guideline, (2) GPs who are not familiar with
the Guideline, and (3) medical and research students
who have no clinical general practice expertise. The tool
was found to have a scale reliability score of Cronbach ’s
α=0.74.
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcomes will capture the effect of the inter-
vention on patient health status and work participation.
Patient health status will be measured using the short-
form 36-item version 2 (SF-36 v2) [ 38] and the Depres-
sion and Anxiety Stress Scale-21 item (DASS-21) [ 39].
Work participation will be measured using the return to
work items within the Australian National Return To
Work Survey [ 40].
The SF-36 v2 provides measures for mental health
symptoms and function, as well as measures of physical
function [ 38]. Since patients with work-related mental
health conditions are likely to experience both psycho-
logical and physical ill health, the SF-36 v2 is an appro-
priate measure to assess health status [ 41]. Due to
heterogeneity in the mental health conditions experi-
enced by participating patients, it is necessary to use a
broad measure of health that is capable of measuring
changes in psychological health. The SF-36 v2 Mental
Component Score and Mental Health Domain Score are
strongly correlated with measures for depression, anx-
iety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use
[42], which are common work-related mental health
conditions. The SF-36 v2 is also sensitive to change fol-
lowing intervention.The DASS-21 assesses the presence and severity of the
core symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress [ 39].
Accordingly, the DASS-21 allows not only a way to
measure the severity of a patient ’s symptoms but a
means by which a patient ’s response to treatment can
also be measured. The National Return To Work survey
has been used by the Australian government for over 18
years to assess level of work participation for people
who are working and those who are not [ 40].
Patient endpoints are at the time of their initial ap-
pointment with the GP (T0, baseline) and every 3
months after that for 9 months. Patients will be provided
paper or electronic links to relevant surveys (including
specific measures of psychological disorder) or they will
be able to provide their responses via a structured tele-
phone interview, as per their preference. Data for both
GP and patient outcomes will be collated electronically
using REDCap [ 43].
Economic evaluation
The economic evaluation will take a societal perspective
in quantifying the additional costs (savings) and health
gains associated with the intervention within the trial
period. The primary outcome for the economic evalu-
ation will be GP concordance with guideline recommen-
dations. The secondary outcome for the economic
evaluation will be quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in
participating patients; calculated based on SF-36 v2 data
at each time-point [ 44] and using an area-under-the-
curve approach.
The cost analysis will capture direct costs of the inter-
vention and control conditions (based on project records
and fidelity data), medical costs during the trial period,
and productivity gains during the trial period. Medical
costs will be estimated based on patient-level adminis-
trative data from the Medicare Benefits Scheme (MBS),
from Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), and from
workers ’compensation schemes (for those patients who
submit a claim and provide consent for data access), plus
patient self-report of health service use funded by other
payers (e.g. hospitalisations and allied health care). Prod-
uctivity gains will be estimated based on patient-level
data regarding return to work from the National Return
To Work Survey items. Results of the economic evalu-
ation will be expressed as cost per point improvement in
concordance with the Guideline, and cost per QALY
gained.
Realist evaluation
A realist evaluation of the intervention will be conducted
using three methods: a knowledge, attitudes, and prac-
tice questionnaire provided to GPs at baseline and 9
months later, interviews with a random sample of 20
GPs and 20 participants upon completion of theMazza et al. Implementation Science           (2021) 16:77 Page 7 of 11
intervention, and qualitative analysis of the social inter-
actions on the community of practice. All decisions, tai-
loring and modifications to the structure, format,
content, or design of the community of practice will also
be documented in a log book.
Planning for sustainability
A stakeholder workshop will be held to identify how the
intervention can be sustained following completion of
the trial. Outcome data from the intervention, economic
evaluation, and process evaluation will be presented for
consideration and reflection by participants.
Blinding
Given that the intervention involves active engagement
with GPs, it is inevitable that GPs will become aware of
their group allocation as the study progresses. Patients,
however, will not be informed about whether their GP
clinic has received the intervention. Clinical trial coordi-
nators will be blinded to the group allocation during
quantitative and qualitative data collection; however, it is
possible that they will be able to identify a GP ’s alloca-
tion by the content of their conversations. The study
project officer and research assistant will be involved in
coordinating and delivering the intervention and will,
therefore, not be blinded to group allocation. All GP and
patient data will be de-identified by the research assist-
ant before analysis for the primary outcome.
Statistical methods
Primary analysis
The main analysis examining the primary outcome (pro-
portion of guideline concordance) will be intention to
treat using multilevel regression models (linear or Pois-
son regression, as appropriate), with time-point and
intervention status as fixed effects. Clusters will be ex-
amined as a random effect for inclusion into the model.
Covariates will include the stratification factors, which
are state, clinic size (GP equivalent full time >5 (yes/
no)), and location (urban vs regional/rural).
Secondary analysis
Patient analyses : Using a similar mixed model approach
as in the main analyses, changes in patient health status
(using the SF-36 v2), and work participation (using rele-
vant measures of the National Return To Work Survey)
will be measured by comparing the scores on patient
surveys from baseline to 3, 6, and 9 months following
their initial GP consultation.
Adjusted analyses : The main analysis and subgroup
analyses above include adjustment for the stratification
factors, which are state, clinic size (GP equivalent full
time >5 (yes/no)), and location (urban vs regional/rural),
additional mental health training.Missing data : As the GP and patient-level data are lon-
gitudinal samples, a missing data analysis will be done
on each longitudinal data set and investigations made
for predictors of missingness. These investigations will
examine the effect of key demographic and other factors
particularly on the presence of missing outcomes. If out-
come data is found to not be missing at random, then
multiple imputation will be applied using the predictors
for missingness.
Data monitoring
A data monitoring committee will meet quarterly to re-
view study data during the period of recruitment and
intervention, and interim analysis will be supplied to the
Executive Team at scheduled occasions and on request
and in confidence.
Harms
We do not anticipate any harms to GP or patient partici-
pants as a result of participating in this study.
Discussion
The challenges described by some GPs when managing
work-related mental health conditions reflect gaps in
knowledge as well as the absence of pragmatic effective
strategies to implement Guideline recommendations and
a likely lack of confidence in implementing these strat-
egies [ 4,11]. The IMPRovE intervention will address
these challenges using a complex intervention that com-
prises academic detailing, a community of practice, and
the provision of resources to improve Guideline-
concordance amongst participating GPs.
Firstly, tailored academic detailing will be provided to
each GP cluster in the intervention. This session will be
led by a GP opinion leader, who will introduce the
Guideline, identify evidence-based practice gaps in
current clinical practice, and provide GP participants
with practical and tailored strategies during the aca-
demic detailing session. This phase of the intervention
will raise awareness of the issue amongst participants,
highlight areas of behaviour change in their own prac-
tice, and create an initial sense of enthusiasm regarding
implementing the Guideline recommendations. Sec-
ondly, the digital community of practice will provide
GPs with opportunities to increase their learning; receive
advice about other clinical dilemmas that were not ad-
dressed in the initial academic detailing session, or test
and adjust their own practices; and assist their col-
leagues to develop implementation strategies for a range
of issues related to mental health conditions that have
arisen as a result of work. Engagement with the GP
opinion leader will continue on the community of prac-
tice platform, thus re-enforcing the credibility of discus-
sions and learnings on the community of practice.Mazza et al. Implementation Science           (2021) 16:77 Page 8 of 11
Finally, during the academic detailing session, GP partic-
ipants will receive a suite of resources that can assist
them to implement the Guideline, along with advice
about how to use these resources (e.g. to monitor patient
improvement), and a more comprehensive resource li-
brary will be offered via the community of practice.
The IMPRovE intervention has been constructed in re-
sponse to the self-reported barriers that sometimes pre-
vent GPs from providing optimal care for people with
work-related mental health conditions [ 11], as well as
theoretical principles of normalisation process theory
[15]. As the IMPRovE intervention involves both peers
and opinion leaders, they offer participating GPs the
peer-to-peer social influences that are well regarded by
clinicians when making choices about their clinical prac-
tice [ 17]. The flexible nature of the academic detailing
session enables the GP opinion leader to adapt a session
so that it meets the needs of the GP participants [ 20].
Similarly, the flexible nature of a community of practice
enables clinicians to choose what topics they engage
with and how [ 45]. Providing GPs with credible and rele-
vant resources will equip GPs with practical tools for use
in their clinical practice [ 28]. Together, the intervention
components are likely to improve guideline concordance
because they are based on social interactions, tailored to
the needs of participating GPs, accompanied by credible
and evidence-based advice from opinion leaders, and re-
inforced over a period of time [ 15,16,18].
The IMPRovE intervention has also been designed
with acceptability and sustainability in mind. The inter-
vention and its components were created in collabor-
ation with a reference group of GPs and researchers, as
well as an intervention advisory group that included
GPs, mental health consumers, and representatives of
workers ’compensation schemes. A steering group com-
prising members from three key clinical organisations
(representing Australian GPs, psychologists and psychia-
trists, respectively) as well as representatives of compen-
sation agencies and a key non-government mental
health organisation, Beyond Blue , also provided advice
and guidance about the health system and policy con-
text. Co-design with GPs who are the end-users of the
intervention, and with policy makers who influence the
compensation landscape and have the capacity to sustain
the intervention into the future, should yield a more ef-
fective and sustainable intervention.
Finally, the IMPRovE trial has been designed using a
practical approach to maximise feasibility. For instance,
whilst guideline concordance would ideally be measured
in routine clinical practice, GPs in our trial are likely to
see a relatively small number of patients with work-
related mental health conditions each year. Conse-
quently, we have chosen to use virtual simulated patient
scenarios as a practical yet rigorous approach tomeasuring our primary outcome of guideline concord-
ance. We have also chosen this method of assessment
due to the nature of the Guideline recommendations,
which provide no specific outcomes that can be audited
in a case note analysis. For instance, outcomes such as
“consideration of social factors, or symptoms that may
indicate comorbidities ”may not be recorded in case
notes, even if a GP does consider these factors in their
clinical decision-making process. All secondary outcome
measures are based on widely used pre-existing surveys
or scales using established methodologies.
Conclusions
Researchers, governments, and guideline developers in-
vest significant time and funds to facilitate guideline im-
plementation in primary care. The IMPRovE study will
assess the effectiveness of a complex intervention on
guideline implementation in the context of work-related
mental health conditions. If this intervention proves to
be effective and cost-effective, the IMPRovE study will
chart a clear path to evidence-informed care for people
with work-related mental health conditions.
