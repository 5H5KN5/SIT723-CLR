Abstract
Background: Imagining one’s own future (episodic future thinking, EFT) has helped mothers 
with overweight purchase healthier groceries during an online shopping task in the laboratory. The 
present study explored whether delivering an EFT intervention to participant’s devices via an 
ecological momentary intervention (EMI) tool would help mother’s purchase healthier food at 
brick-and-mortar stores.
Methods: Participants (N=43, mother’s 31–52 years of age, BMI≥24.9 kg/m2) were randomized 
to EFT or standardized episodic thinking (SET). EFT cues include a positive and vivid description 
of future events while SET cues focus on the recent experience of playing games in the laboratory. 
Cues were uploaded to participant profiles on an EMI site. Participants were trained on how to 
read and listen to cues as well as how to detail purchases. Participants received text reminders to 
listen to cues before shopping and returned with receipts the following day. Receipt data was 
analyzed to derive dependent variables, calories and nutrients purchased per person. Correlations 
were used to analyze associations between study variables of interest and ANOV As were 
conducted to compare dietary variables by group.
Results: Participants in the EFT group purchased fewer calories than participants in the SET 
control group ( F(1,41)=6.25, p=0.02;ηp2 =.13) as well as fewer grams of fat 
(F(1,41)=10.03, p<0.01;ηp2= .20), saturated fat ( F(1,41)=6.15, p =0.02;ηp2=.13), and sodium 
(F(1,41)=7.93, p<0.01;ηp2 = .16).
Conclusion: Delivering EFT cues to participant devices may be a promising way to improve the 
calorie and nutrient content of food purchases. Future research should include a longer follow-up 
and analyze calorie changes over time.

The access and availability of obesogenic foods in the home is an important determinant in 
energy balance, and hence obesity. The increased availability of high-calorie foods in the 
home has been associated with the overconsumption of these foods ( Campbell et al., 2007 ), 
inadequate fruit and vegetable intake ( Rosenkranz & Dzewaltowski, 2008 ), and overweight 
and obesity ( Birch & Ventura, 2009 ). The majority of calories consumed by a family come 
from foods purchased by parents, specifically mothers ( Scaglioni, Arrizza, Vecchi, & 
Tedeschi, 2011 ). Although traditional gender roles are changing, the most recent research 
still shows that mothers are the primary household food shoppers ( PLMA, 2013 ) and 
primary food preparers ( Hannon, Bowen, Moinpour, & McLerran, 2003 ) for the majority of 
families. As a result, mothers have a significant effect on the eating behaviors and health 
outcomes of their children. Due to the overwhelming influence of mothers on family food 
consumption through food shopping and preparation, an intervention to help overweight and 
obese mothers purchase healthier food (e.g. fewer calories, better macronutrient profiles) 
may promote better dietary behaviors for the entire family and has the potential to reduce 
family overweight and obesity.
Episodic future thinking (EFT) is the ability to mentally project oneself into the future to 
pre-experience an event that could potentially occur ( Atance & O’Neill, 2001 ; Schacter, 
Benoit, & Szpunar, 2017 ; Szpunar, 2010 ). The degree to which a person engages in EFT 
affects the way they make decisions in the present ( Schacter, Benoit, & Szpunar, 2017 ), such 
that when people are cued to think about their personal future, they make more adaptive 
decisions in the moment. Other benefits of EFT include improvements in affect (e.g. reduced 
anxiety), prospective memory (e.g. remembering to complete a planned action), and spatial 
navigation (e.g. remembering the route to a goal) ( Schacter, Benoit, & Szpunar, 2017 ). 
Prompting people to vividly imagine their future has been used as a behavioral intervention 
to improve self-regulation in some tempting situations ( Daniel, Stanton, & Epstein, 2013b ).
Discounting of the future (e.g. “delay discounting”, DD), a preference for a smaller 
immediate reward (e.g. junk food consumption) over a larger distant reward (e.g. future 
health) ( Rung & Madden, 2018 ), has been associated with numerous maladaptive behaviors 
and outcomes, including obesity ( Epstein, Salvy, Carr, Dearing, & Bickel, 2010 ). Recent 
research has also shown that DD is related to participant’s food purchasing, such that greater 
discounting of the future is significantly associated with purchasing higher calorie foods and 
lower healthy eating index scores ( Appelhans, Tangney, French, Crane, & Wang, 2019 ).
EFT is an intervention that has successfully decreased discounting of the future and may 
help people to resist temptation ( Daniel et al., 2013b ). EFT has decreased consumption in 
hypothetical alcohol and cigarette ( Snider, LaConte, & Bickel, 2016 ; Stein, Tegge, Turner, & 
Bickel, 2018 ) purchasing tasks, as well as a self-administered cigarette smoking task ( Stein 
et al., 2016 ). The impacts of EFT on eating behaviors have also been studied, and EFT 
training has reduced energy intake in ad libitum eating tasks for adults in a laboratory setting 
(Daniel, Stanton, & Epstein, 2013a ), adults in a cafeteria setting ( O’Neill, Daniel, & Epstein, 
2016 ), and children in a laboratory setting ( Daniel, Said, Stanton, & Epstein, 2015 ).
The NIH Stages Model is a translational research framework that describes how basic 
science can be used to inform the design, refinement, and implementation of interventions to Hollis-Hansen et al. Page 2

help improve clinical health outcomes (Onken, Carroll, et. al, 2015). The model establishes 
an iterative process that seeks to identify 1) the causes and mechanisms by which an 
intervention is working throughout the entire development of the intervention, 2) why, how, 
and for whom results may sometimes be sub-optimal, and 3) what adaptations can be made 
to bolster the effects and/or implement the intervention into new settings (Onken et. al, 
2015). Using EFT as an intervention is predicated on basic science findings that explain the 
adaptive mechanisms and functions of EFT ( Schacter, Benoit, & Szpunar, 2017 ), in 
particular EFT’s potential to influence DD ( Critchfield & Kollins, 2001 ) and subsequent 
health behaviors. The present study is part of a larger translational research program that 
seeks to examine and refine EFT interventions to change behavior and reduce chronic 
disease burden.
In the first applications of using EFT to modify mother’s food shopping behaviors (NIH 
“Stage 1”) we tested EFT in the laboratory and found that participants who use EFT before 
and during grocery shopping purchase fewer calories and healthier nutrient profiles than 
participants in control conditions in an online grocery store ( Hollis-Hansen, Seidman, 
O’Donnell, & Epstein, 2019a ). To systematically replicate those findings we set out to 
examine whether EFT could improve food purchasing behavior in the natural environment. 
As a secondary exploratory hypothesis, we sought to identify whether EFT could influence 
DD in an uncued context, as it is one of the hypothesized underlying mechanisms by which 
EFT is thought to improve health decision-making (e.g. in this case, grocery purchases). If 
people in an EFT group show increases on the DD task when not cued to think about their 
future during the task, it could be an indication that listening to the cues over a period of 
time may help EFT to become a “default” way of thinking that changes decision-making 
even when unprompted.
The present study utilizes an ecological momentary intervention (EMI) platform, an 
intervention delivered to participants in real time in their usual setting. EMIs implemented 
through mobile technology have been effective in several behavioral interventions, including 
smoking cessation, diabetes self-management, and weight loss ( Heron & Smyth, 2010 ). The 
“Mobile Audio Manager and Response Tracker” (MAMRT) EMI tool used in the present 
study has been shown to be feasible for the delivery of EFT outside of the laboratory and has 
the potential to reduce parent weight and energy intake ( Sze, Daniel, Kilanowski, Collins, & 
Epstein, 2015 ). In the present study, we used MAMRT to deliver an early-phase EFT 
intervention to mothers before they went grocery shopping or made food purchases for their 
household.
METHODS
The present study was a between subject’s design with participants randomized to an 
episodic future thinking (EFT) group or a standardized episodic thinking (SET) control. 
Ethical standards were followed and the study was approved by the University at Buffalo 
Social and Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board on 9/17/2018 (Study ID: 
00002757).Hollis-Hansen et al. Page 3

Participants were recruited through e-mails from our Division of Behavioral Medicine 
participant database, fliers on open message boards throughout the Buffalo community, and 
targeted Facebook ads. Recruitment materials directed interested community members to an 
online eligibility screener where they answered demographic questions, a brief health history 
questionnaire, and one-item on recent participation in grocery or EFT studies. Individuals 
were excluded if: they did not have a child between the age of 2 and 15 in the household for 
whom they buy groceries; they self-reported untreated psychopathologies, as their illness 
may impair their ability to positively and vividly imagine their own personal future ( Roepke 
& Seligman, 2016 ); if their calculated body mass index (BMI) was ≤ 24.9, which indicated 
they were normal weight; if they reported eating disorders, as the illness may influence the 
food one is buying; and lastly if they participated in an EFT study within the past six 
months, in order to eliminate the possibility of carryover effects. The one-item on previous 
participation asked “Have you recently participated in another research study involving 
grocery shopping or generating cues?”, with the “Yes” response requiring an answer to an 
open-field that said “If yes, please describe the study and when you participated”. To be 
eligible for the present study participants must have indicated “no” or that they participated 
≥ 6-months prior to the present study.
Included participants (N = 43) were mother’s aged 31 – 52 years of age with a BMI ≥ 25.0 
(Range to 60.9, Mean = 36.0 ± 7.4). Detailed participant and study characteristics can be 
found in Table 1. One participant randomized to the SET control group completed the 
baseline appointment and used the MAMRT application once, but failed to return with 
receipts after repeated attempts to reschedule and collect follow-up data. The participant’s 
data was not included in the analyses as we did not collect baseline receipt data from which 
to impute follow-up receipt data and researchers report it is unnecessary to impute data when 
there is <5% missing ( Jakobsen, Gluud, Wettersley, Winkel, 2017 ).
The study was designed to take place over a three-day period. Participant baseline 
appointments were scheduled via phone or text message for the day before the participant 
planned to grocery shop. Participants were randomized to the EFT intervention group or the 
SET control group at the baseline appointment. The participant shopped on Day 2 and 
returned on Day 3 with receipts. There were two cases where participants had a family 
circumstance which led to rescheduling their follow-up appointments for 15 days and 22 
days after baseline. In those instances, participants were instructed to wait to use their cues 
and collect receipts until the day before their new follow-up appointment date, so that the 
same number of days would be collected even though there was a difference in time between 
appointment.
At the beginning of the baseline session participants completed a paper demographic 
questionnaire ( Gage-Bouchard & Devine, 2014 ) which included questions on their age, race/
ethnicity, education, income, house size, perceived social status, and their use of government 
benefit programs.
After the demographic questionnaire participants completed a computer based adjusting 
amount delay discounting task. The adjusting amount task asks people if they would rather 
have X (smaller) amount of money now or Y (larger) amount of money at different time Hollis-Hansen et al. Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
points in the future ( Sze et al., 2015 ). The amount of money available in the present stays the 
same, while the amount of money in the future increases or decreases by 50% of the 
preceding value. For this study participants were asked how much of a commodity (e.g., 
money) they would prefer immediately over a larger reward after 5 time delays (1 day, 1 
week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year) ( Koffarnus & Bickel, 2014 ). These choices provide us 
with an indifference point for each time delay – the point when the decision-maker is 
indifferent to the delay or has equal preference for both choices ( Odum, 2011 ). One’s 
indifference points are used to plot a curve, and the area-under-the-curve (AUC) is used to 
quantify how much they discount the future, with a lower AUC indicating a greater tendency 
to discount the future ( Odum, 2011 ).
After the DD task, participants completed an online survey, with the following measures 
included. We collected the shopping habits survey because people are known to shop in 
different locations at different frequencies ( Minaker et al., 2016 ). This survey asks 
participants how frequently they buy or procure food from supermarkets, supercenters, food 
co-ops, convenience stores, specialty stores, farmers’ markets, food banks, and home 
delivery. Response options range from “Never/rarely” (infrequent, “0”) to “Once or more per 
week” (frequent, “5”). We measured food insecurity using the USDA Economic Research 
Service 6-item short form of the food security survey module ( Blumberg, Bialostosky, 
Hamilton, & Briefel, 1999 ) as food insecurity may influence the quantity and quality of food 
purchased ( Dachner, Ricciuto, Kirkpatrick, & Tarasuk, 2010 ). The CFC scale is a 12 item 
scale that measures whether people identify themselves as immediate or future focused in 
their day-to-day decision-making and actions (e.g. “I only act to satisfy immediate concerns, 
figuring the future will take care of itself.”) ( Strathman, Gleicher, Boninger, & Edwards, 
1994 ). Respondents indicate whether an item is characteristic to them on a scale from 1 
(“extremely uncharacteristic) to 5 (“extremely characteristic”). We included 5-items on fruit 
and vegetable (F&V) intake and 2-items on fast food and regular restaurant intake from the 
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey ( Moore et al., 2015 ). The F&V items were 
included to determine participant’s baseline healthy food consumption. We included the fast 
food and restaurant items as a precaution and planned to control for them if we found group 
differences, as we anticipated that people who report eating outside of the home more 
frequently would be buying and eating fewer groceries.
After completing questionnaires, participants generated text cues on Qualtrics (a survey 
platform) with a research assistant following similar procedures as our previous studies 
(Hollis-Hansen, Seidman, et al., 2019a ). Participants in all groups played five mobile 
application games (e.g. Flow Free, Trivia Crack, Bubble Witch, Geometry Dash, Solitaire) 
and rated each game on a scale from one to five where one was “do not like at all” and five 
was “like very much”.
Participants then played their three top-rated mobile application games immediately before 
generating cues.
Participants in the EFT group are asked to vividly imagine and describe a positive future 
event or experience that could really happen or that they already have planned for 1-month, 
6-months, and 1-year in the future. The cues include the event or experience, who is with Hollis-Hansen et al. Page 5

them, where they are, what they are doing, and how they are feeling (“In about 1 month I am 
sitting at my kitchen table singing happy birthday to my daughter. She is blowing out the 
candles and we are clapping and laughing. We are talking about what she wished for and our 
dreams for the year ahead. We are feeling happy to spend this time together as a family.”). 
The research assistant guides them through the process of writing the cue and transcribes 
their description into Qualtrics.
Participants in the SET control group generate cues similarly, but they are asked to vividly 
imagine the experience of playing the mobile application games during their laboratory 
appointment. SET participants provide a detailed description of their experience in a similar 
style as the EFT cue, including who, what, where, and how they are feeling (“About 10 
minutes ago I was playing Geometry Dash on a tablet in a beige room at UB. In the game, I 
was a square, jumping over other geometrical obstacles, racing to the finish line. I was 
feeling happy as I cleared a difficult level.”).
In both groups participants are asked how vividly they can imagine the place where they are, 
the time of the day, and what is going on around them when they picture their event or 
experience as well as how much they like the event or experience. Though it did not happen 
in the present study, participants who rate the event or experience below a “3” on a scale 
from 1 (not at all vivid/do not like at all) to 5 (very vivid/like very much) would have been 
asked to pick a different event or experience.
After creating cues, the research assistant directed the participant to read their cues out loud 
and recorded the cues using Audacity, a computer voice recording program. The text and 
audio cues were uploaded to our EMI platform, MAMRT, and attached to the participants 
personal MAMRT account. Participants were trained on how to use MAMRT and 
demonstrated an ability to independently access their account and practice their cues before 
leaving their baseline appointment. Participants were given a training guide on how and 
when to use MAMRT. Participants were asked to practice (e.g. read and listen to) their cues 
on the evening they created them and during the day before they went grocery shopping for a 
total of two cue recalls. Participants were sent a reminder to listen to their cues by a 
scheduled text or e-mail. After participants read and listened to their cues, they were 
presented with a series of manipulation check questions, such as how vivid their thoughts 
were about their cues (Likert scale, 1 [not at all vivid] – 5 [very vivid]), how much they were 
paying attention to their cues (Likert scale, 1 [not at all] – 5 [very much]), where they were 
completing their thought training (open-ended text entry), how they were feeling in the 
moment (open-ended text entry), and what decision(s) they were thinking about in the 
moment (open-ended text entry). The attention and vividness questions were used to confirm 
whether or not the cues were distinctly imagined, and if the participant was paying attention 
while completing their thought training (e.g. cue recalls). Additionally, MAMRT records 
each time the participant completes a cue recall, and we created the variable “number of cue 
recalls” to analyze whether there were group differences in how frequently participants 
accessed their cues.
In addition to the MAMRT training guide, participants received a thorough explanation of 
how to properly document their food purchases and were sent home with food receipt forms Hollis-Hansen et al. Page 6

and a food receipt training guide adapted from the ShOPPER study ( Appelhans et al., 2019 ; 
French, Tangney, Crane, Wang, & Appelhans, 2019). The food receipt forms ask participants 
to give a very detailed and thorough explanation of the food items they purchased (e.g. 
whole fat, low-fat, brand name), the size of the item, and the price. Participants were 
unrestricted as to where they could make food purchases. Though the main focus of the 
intervention was on changing grocery purchases, we also collected and analyzed receipts on 
all food purchases (e.g. fast food, restaurant, takeout, etc.) to provide a complete picture of 
calories purchased during the intervention period.
At the follow-up appointment participants returned with all of their food shopping receipt(s) 
and the completed food receipt forms. While research assistants reviewed the receipts in the 
control room, participants completed a follow-up DD task that was identical to the task at 
the baseline appointment. In most studies on DD, participant’s EFT or control cues are 
presented while the participant is tasked with selecting their preferred amount of money (e.g. 
participants are shown their cue and instructed to read and think about their cue while 
making a choice about money now or later) (O’Donnell, Hollis-Hansen, & Epstein, 2019). 
We did not display the participant’s cues during the follow-up DD task for this study as we 
wanted to explore whether EFT could improve DD in an uncued context (e.g. become a 
“default” way of thinking).
After participants completed the DD task and research assistants finished reviewing receipts, 
research assistants did a thorough receipt interview with the participant, matching each 
receipt item to the details on the food receipt form. Research assistants inquired about any 
additional information that would help to properly match the food item when inputting the 
item into NutrionistPro for nutrient analysis. For example, if the participant purchased 
yogurt and failed to specify what type of yogurt on the food receipt form, the participant was 
asked what type of yogurt (e.g. Greek, whole fat, low-fat, etc.) and if anything was added to 
the item that wasn’t already indicated by the receipt or food receipt form (e.g. fruit, nuts, 
chocolate, etc.).
Participant grocery receipts were analyzed using NutritionistPro, following the same 
procedures as described in Hollis-Hansen et. al, 2019 to determine the dependent variables 
of calories and nutrients purchased per person in the household ( Hollis-Hansen, Seidman, et 
al., 2019a ). Receipts were input and reviewed by two separate research assistants, and then 
checked again by the first author.
Participants were paid $20.00 at the end of the first appointment, $25.00 at the end of their 
second appointment, and had a 1-in-10 chance to win a $100 gift card to a local grocery 
store. After every 10 participants, 10 ID numbers were input into a random number 
generator and the participant that was selected returned to the laboratory to pick up the gift 
card and sign a receipt. Those who did not win received an e-mail to inform them the 
drawing had taken place.
We previously conducted two studies to test whether EFT could improve online grocery 
shopping in the laboratory (Hollis-Hansen et al., 2019). Our first laboratory study used a 
semantic control group and our second laboratory study used the SET control group we Hollis-Hansen et al. Page 7

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
planned to use for the present study. Therefore, to power the present study, we used the 
effect size from our second laboratory study (cohen’s f = .51 or ηp2 = 0.106), which to our 
knowledge provides the closest comparable estimate available. Using the second laboratory 
study’s effect size, we determined that the present study would require a minimum of 34 
subjects or 17 subjects per group at an alpha of .05 and power of .80 to detect a between-
subjects effect on calories. To be more conservative, we wanted to have a minimum of 20 
people per group and increased the sample size to 44 subjects, with the assumption that up to 
4 people (10%) would dropout based on rates from a similar field experiment ( O’Neil, et. al, 
2016 ). We only had one person fail to return for their follow-up appointment which resulted 
in 43 subjects in the total sample.
Between-group analysis of variance (ANOV A) and chi-square tests were used to identify 
differences in participant characteristics or important study characteristics (e.g. 
demographics, number of times participants used MAMRT, attention to cues, how vividly 
one imagined their cues, amount spent on groceries, etc.) that may influence the dependent 
variable. Fisher’s exact test was used for any categorical variable with less than 5 in a given 
cell (e.g. percent overweight).
There were a few variables we measured that we thought may influence the independent or 
dependent variable, such as: baseline delay discounting as it’s related to the central theory 
guiding the present research; income, as the amount of money one has may dictate how 
much they buy and the quality of the food they buy; the frequency at which participants shop 
at the grocery store as with the short study timeline we were concerned we may not catch a 
representative snapshot of calories for those who shop more frequently; how often people 
listened to their cues, and how much they paid attention to their cues. Therefore, in addition 
to looking at between-group differences on these variables, we also looked at Pearson 
correlations between study variables of interest.
To address the primary research hypotheses, we used between-group analysis of variance 
(ANOV A) with randomized group assignment as the independent variable and calories and 
nutrients purchased as dependent variables in separate models. To address the secondary 
research hypothesis, we used a repeated-measures ANOV A with group as the independent 
variable and baseline and follow-up AUC as the dependent variables. As baseline DD (AUC) 
was correlated with calories purchased and is theoretically relevant to the dependent variable 
(Appelhans et al., 2019 ), we also included it as a covariate in a separate model (ANCOV A) 
to confirm whether it would alter findings.
RESULTS
Between-groups ANOV As and chi-square tests resulted in no statistical differences between 
groups for demographic or control variables, except the percent of participant’s who were 
overweight versus obese, as there was only one overweight subject in the control group 
(Table 1). Participant’s baseline DD (e.g. AUC) was inversely correlated with calories (r(43) 
= − .33, p < .05), such that a higher baseline AUC was associated with fewer calories 
purchased and higher CFC scores (r(43) = .32, p < .05), consistent with our proposed 
theoretical framework. Participant’s supermarket shopping frequency was also correlated Hollis-Hansen et al. Page 8

with calories (r(43) = −.45, p < .01), such that people who shopped at supermarkets more 
frequently purchased fewer calories. We found that age was inversely associated with fast 
food (r(43) = −.31, p < .05) and home delivery purchases (r(43) = −.30, p < .05). Higher 
income was associated with more frequent supermarket shopping (r(43) = .39, p < .05) and 
less frequent use of food pantries (r(43) = −.39, p < .01). Receipt of government benefits 
(e.g. TANF, SNAP, WIC, etc.) was associated with less frequent supermarket shopping 
(r(43) = −.32, p < .05) , and more frequent supercenter (r(43) = .36, p < .05), corner store 
(r(43) = .31, p < .05), and pantry (r(43) = .35, p < .05) shopping. Food insecurity was 
associated with a lower baseline AUC (r(43) = −.38, p < .05) and more frequent supercenter 
(r(43) = .34, p < .05), corner store (r(43) = .33, p < .05), pantry (r(43) = .47, p < .01), and 
home delivery (r(43) = .56, p < .01) shopping. Higher education was associated with fewer 
corner store (r(43) = −.49, p < .01) and fast food (r(43) = −.31, p < .05) trips. All correlations 
are reported in an online-only supplement (Table 2).
Participants in the EFT group purchased significantly fewer calories (M = 7,650 ± SD = 
5,095) than the SET control group (Mean = 12,470 ± SD = 7,471), ( F(1,41) = 6.25, p=0.02; 
ηp2 =.13) (See Figure 1A). Additionally, EFT participants purchased fewer grams of fat 
(F(1,41) = 10.03, p<0.01; ηp2= .20), saturated fat ( F(1,41) = 6.15, p = 0.02; ηp2=.13), and 
fewer milligrams of sodium ( F(1,41) = 7.93, p<0.01; ηp2 = .16) than the SET control group 
(See Figure 1B, 1C, and 1D). No significant differences were found on grams of 
carbohydrates ( F(1,41) = 1.46, p = 0.23; ηp2=.03) or sugar purchased ( F(1,41) = 0.59, p = 
0.45; ηp2=.01). After controlling for baseline AUC, effects remained significant for calories 
(F(1,40) = 4.29, p=0.05), grams of fat ( F(1,40) = 7.47, p<0.01), grams of saturated fat 
(F(1,40) = 4.04, p = 0.05), and milligrams of sodium ( F(1,40) = 5.99, p = 0.02) purchased.
There was no significant change in uncued DD from baseline to follow-up ( F(1,41) = 2.78, 
p=0.10; ηp2 =.06) though results were trending in the right direction.
Participants used and accessed their cues using any device that connected to the internet, and 
the majority of cue recalls (e.g. times listening to the cues) were conducted using the 
participant’s smartphone (91.11%), followed by computers (7.78%), and tablets (1.11%). 
Most recalls were completed within the participant’s home (60.22%) or in their car 
(33.33%), often in the grocery store parking lot. A few cue recalls were completed at the 
participant’s work (5.38%) or at a relative’s home (1.07%). The number of cue recalls across 
participants range from zero to eight, with an average of two recalls (Mean = 2.07 ± SD = 
1.06). 70% of participants listened as instructed by the protocol (two times) and 12% 
listened more than two times. 16% listened one time and one participant did not use the 
application after their baseline appointment (2.3%).
DISCUSSION
Delivering an EFT intervention to the participants preferred device (e.g. smartphone, 
computer or tablet) via a mobile web application helped mothers make healthier food 
purchases during this pilot study. Previously we showed that EFT helped mothers with 
overweight and obesity to purchase healthier groceries in a hypothetical grocery shopping 
task in the laboratory. In this study, we systematically replicated and extended that finding as Hollis-Hansen et al. Page 9

EFT helped mother’s purchase fewer calories and healthier nutrient profiles while shopping 
at their preferred brick-and-mortar stores.
In the present study 82% of participants adhered to the research protocol by listening to their 
cues a minimum of two times, and 98% listened to their cues at least once before shopping. 
All but one participant completed the study and all of those who completed the follow-up 
appointment returned with their receipts and food receipt forms. Participants in the EFT 
group reported that thinking about future events was a positive experience for them, and 
thinking about those events seemed to help parents to improve their food purchasing choices 
given that their purchases were on average lower calorie, lower fat, and lower sodium than 
the control group.
The NIH Stages model proposes that when developing an intervention there should be 
multiple refinements while moving towards effectiveness (“Stage IV”) and implementation 
and dissemination (“Stage V”) trials (Onken, Carroll, et. al, 2015). Our findings from this 
Stage I/II study suggest, 1) that EFT may have helped people make more adaptive decisions 
when they were in a tempting situation or location, such as shopping at a store and 2) that 
using a mobile EMI application may have helped prompt people to think about their future 
when they were in a natural environment outside of a research laboratory, but there is still a 
great deal to explore.
One possible avenue for exploration is whether EFT interventions (e.g. generation and recall 
of EFT cues) can make future-orientation a “default” way of thinking in tempting situations, 
which is why we chose not to present the cues while the participant was completing the 
follow-up DD task in the present study. Withholding cues may have been one reason we did 
not see a statistically significant change in DD from baseline to follow-up, given that 
participants were prompted to think about their cues before they went shopping (where we 
found an effect), but not before they engaged in the DD task. Alternatively, these findings 
could also suggest that it may take longer than 48 hours and two cue recalls for EFT to 
become a “default” way of thinking in uncued contexts. It’s possible that EFT interventions 
are less effective when participants are unprompted to think about their cues ( Rung & 
Madden, 2019 ), but it is also possible that people need more frequent exposure to their cues 
and more opportunities to use their cues in tempting situations in order to change their 
default way of thinking and decision-making. Future research with longer follow-up should 
seek to establish whether it is possible to make EFT a “default” way of thinking when faced 
with temporal decisions as well as to identify the appropriate dose and duration of EFT 
interventions.
The present study has many strengths, including an experimental design, a validated control 
group ( Hollis-Hansen, O’Donnell, Seidman, Brande, & Epstein, 2019b ), and a sample 
powered to detect an effect on calories purchased. Additionally, the study is a systematic 
replication of two prior studies which resulted in the same findings on calories, fat, and 
saturated fat ( Hollis-Hansen, Seidman, et al., 2019a ). Further, in this study participants used 
the intervention and went shopping in their preferred environment (outside of the 
laboratory).Hollis-Hansen et al. Page 10

There are limitations of the present study. First, this study only included mothers with 
overweight or obesity because of the academic and consumer literature that indicates 
mothers are the primary food shoppers and food preparers for the household. Therefore, our 
results do not tell us how well EFT works for normal weight women with children, adult 
men and women without children, or for fathers who are primary food shoppers for their 
households. It would be interesting to conduct a study with normal and overweight mothers 
and fathers to identify whether intervening on food purchases early can help to prevent 
weight gain for the entire family. Although prior research has shown that maternal weight 
gain has a stronger association with child’s weight change than father’s ( Whitaker, Jarvis, 
Beeken, Boniface, & Wardle, 2010 ), there could be additive benefits from including fathers 
in future studies ( Davison et al., 2019 ).
Second, people shop at different frequencies throughout the week, which has been 
associated with diet quality ( Minaker et al., 2016 ). To account for that, we included the 
shopping habits survey and tested for group differences on all of the participants reported 
shopping habits, but future studies would benefit from a longer follow-up period to account 
for monthly shopping variations. Third, vitamins and minerals have not been consistently 
reported on food labels and are not consistently reported in nutrition databases, such as 
NutrionistPro. Therefore, we were unable to calculate information on health-promoting 
nutrients. Future studies could attempt to use other nutrition databases that provide these 
outcomes and calculate health-indices, such as the healthy eating index (HEI) ( Krebs-Smith, 
et. al, 2018 ).
Lastly, although we used a validated control group ( Hollis-Hansen et. al, 2019b ), it may not 
adequately control for between group differences in emotional intensity and personal 
significance, given that celebrating a birthday may be more meaningful to participants than 
playing mobile application games. We have been unable to find any research that had 
participant’s subjectively or objectively rate the emotional intensity or personal significance 
of EFT and control cues and therefore we are unsure whether these factors would influence 
DD or health behaviors. The main benefit of SET (the control used in this study) is that it 
standardizes the recent experience for all control participants thereby reducing the variability 
in the control group’s recent cues ( Hollis-Hansen et. al, 2019b ).
It is difficult to resist the temptation to eat highly reinforcing fat, sugar and salt laden foods 
once they are in our immediate environment. In fact, we are biologically driven to want to 
eat those foods ( Finlayson, 2017 ) and our larger social environments (e.g. media and 
advertisements, food stores) are designed to trigger that drive and wanting ( Epstein, Leddy, 
Temple, & Faith, 2007 ). Research suggests that the food one buys is correlated with diet 
quality ( Appelhans et al., 2012 ), as outside of hunger relief programs, virtually no food is 
consumed that was not at one point purchased. Making better food choices at the point of 
purchase may be both a temptation management strategy (e.g. keeping it out of the cart) and 
a temptation prevention strategy (e.g. keeping it out of the home) (Appelhans, French, et. al, 
2017). EFT may help people resist the temptation to buy unhealthy foods because mentally 
simulating one’s own future is associated with improvements in affect, decision-making, 
planning, and spatial navigation (e.g. developing a pathway to achieving a goal) ( Schacter et. 
al, 2017 ). Specifically, EFT may help by 1) improving emotional regulation when someone Hollis-Hansen et al. Page 11

is in a “hot state” after seeing a food cue in the store, 2) by making the future goal (e.g. 
better health or weight loss) seem more salient than the immediate gratification of buying a 
bag of chips, and 3) by encouraging one to think ahead about what food stores one may want 
to frequent or what foods one may want to buy or avoid. If we can use EFT to help parents 
to reduce the temptation to buy unhealthy foods and instead purchase healthier foods for 
their families, we may be able to improve the nutrient profiles of foods purchased, which in 
turn should help people change their home food environment and eating behaviors.

1A BMI of 25.0 to < 30 is considered overweight, a BMI > 30 is considered obese
2Prior participation means that during the eligibility screener the participant indicated previous participation in a study “involving the creation of 
cues” in our laboratory or online ≥ 6-months prior to the present study,
3AUC stands for “area under the curve”, which is used as a measure of delay discounting, a higher AUC (e.g. closer to 1) suggests less discounting 
of the future outcome while a lower AUC (e.g. closer to 0) suggests greater discounting of the future outcome
