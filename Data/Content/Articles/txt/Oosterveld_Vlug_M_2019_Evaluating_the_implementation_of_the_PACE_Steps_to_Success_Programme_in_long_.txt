Abstract
Background: The PACE ‘Steps to Success ’programme is a complex educational and development intervention
for staff to improve palliative care in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). In a cluster randomized controlled trial, this
programme has been implemented in 37 LTCFs in 7 European countries. Alongside an effectiveness study, a
process evaluation study was conducted. This paper reports on the results of this process evaluation, of which the
aim was to provide a more detailed understanding of the implementation of the PACE Programme across and
within countries.
Methods: The process evaluation followed the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance
(RE-AIM) framework and involved various measures and tools, including diaries for country trainers, evaluation
questionnaires for care staff, attendance lists and interviews (online and face-to-face, individual and in groups)
with country trainers, managers, PACE coordinators and other staff members. Based on key elements of the
PACE Programme, a priori criteria for a high, medium and low level of the RE-AIM components Reach, Adoption,
Implementation and intention to Maintenance were defined. Qualitative data on factors affecting each RE-AIM
component gathered in the online discussion groups and interviews were analysed according to the principles
of thematic analysis.
Results: The performance of the PACE Programme on the RE-AIM components was highly variable within and
across countries, with a high or medium score for in total 28 (out of 37) LTCFs on Reach, for 26 LTCFs on Adoption,
for 35 LTCFs on Implementation and for 34 LTCFs on intention to Maintenance. The factors affecting performance
on the different RE-AIM components could be classified into three major categories: (1) the PACE Programme itself
and its way of delivery, (2) people working with the PACE Programme and (3) contextual factors. Several country-
specific challenges in implementing the PACE Programme were identified.

Conclusions: The implementation of the PACE Programme was feasible but leaves room for improvement. Our
analysis helps to better understand the optimal levels of training and facilitation and provides recommendations to
improve implementation in the LTC setting. The results of the process evaluation will be used to further adapt and
improve the PACE Programme prior to its further dissemination.

Introduction
As more and more people live out their lives in nursing
and residential care homes, there are concerns about
t h eq u a l i t yo ft h ee n d - o f - l i f ec a r eg i v e ni nt h e s es e t t i n g s
[1–7]. To improve the quality of palliative care in such
long-term care facilities (LTCFs), the programme
‘PACE Steps to Success ’was designed. The programme
aims to ensure that all residents receive high-quality
palliative care, by facilitating organizational change and
supporting staff to develop their roles around palliative
care. From 2015 to 2017, the programme has been
implemented and tested in a multi-facility clusterrandomized controlled trial in seven European coun-
tries, namely Belgium, England, Finland, Italy, The
Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland [ 8].
The PAlliative Care for older people in Europe
(PACE) Steps to Success Programme is a 1-year multi-
component train-t he-trainer programme for nursing
homes that aims to stepwise implement a palliative
care approach into the day-to-day routines in nursing
homes [ 9] .T h ec o r ec l i n i c a lp a r to ft h eP A C E
Programme consists of six key intervention compo-
nents —the six Steps to Success (see Fig. 1). The
implementation of these six steps was facilitated by a

train-the-trainer approach including a high level of
support to those delivering the training at different
levels. For example, the nomination of staff representa-
tives to champion palliative care within each LTCF,
named ‘PACE coordinators ’was a central feature of
the PACE Steps to Success Programme. These coordi-
nators were supported to develop their knowledge and
skills concerning palliative care and encouraged to em-
power other staff within their organization. The PACE
coordinators were supported by country trainers (clini-
cians or health scientist w ith experience in nursing
homes and/or palliative care) who delivered training
and provided support and education to all staff within
the LTCF. In turn, these country trainers had followed
a 1-week training by experienced international trainers
and supported via monthly 1- h online group-coaching
sessions during the intervention period.
In the first 2 months, the PACE coordinators re-
ceived ‘pre-intervention training ’from the country
trainers. The intervention was then rolled out to all
care staff in the following 6 months, with each se-
quential step of the intervention being delivered in a
training session by the country trainer, one step every
month. Each training covered one of the six key
elements of the intervention (see Fig. 1). The
p r o g r a m m ee n d e dw i t ha4 -month consolidation
phase, in which the tools and actions introduced in
the training sessions were further implemented and
monthly meetings were gradually taken over by the
PACE coordinators and supported by the country
trainer. The intervention was based on the ‘Route to
Success in Long-term Care Facilities ’, a palliative care
intervention developed in the UK [ 10,11]. The Route
to Success builds upon the well-known palliative care
intervention ‘Gold Standards Framework ’(GSF),
which aims to improve palliative care within primary
care and was later adapted for use in long-term care
facilities [ 12,13]. The PACE Steps to Success
Programme is described in detail elsewhere [ 8], and
information packages in various languages are avail-
able from the website of th e European Association for
Palliative Care [ 14].
In the cluster randomized controlled trial, the PACE
Programme did not reach its intended effects [ 15]. We
did not observe improvemen t in the primary resident
outcome ‘comfort in the last week of life ’(reported
after death by staff using the EOLD-CAD [ 16]). The
primary staff outcome ‘knowledge of palliative care ’
( m e a s u r e dw i t hP a l l i a t i v eC a r eS u r v e y[ 17]) improved
significantly, but not to a clinically relevant degree. On
the secondary resident outcome, however, which was
quality of care in the last month of life (reported after
death by staff using the QOD-LTC [ 18]), a significant
improvement could be observed [ 15].Process evaluation study
Process evaluations are recommended to open the
‘black box ’of interventions in trials [ 19]a n da r ec o n -
sidered even more important with complex interven-
tions, i.e. interventions tha t have many potential active
ingredients and that are often difficult to implement
[20–23]. As the PACE Programme is such a complex
intervention, a process e valuation was embedded in
the PACE cluster randomized controlled trial [ 8]. The
process evaluation followed the Reach, Effectiveness,
Adoption, Implementatio n, Maintenance (RE-AIM)
framework to structure the different implementation
factors namely Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Imple-
mentation and Maintenance [ 24]( s e eT a b l e 1for a
definition of each of these domains). These five do-
mains interact to determine the overall impact of a
health intervention programme. This means that an
evidence-based intervention could still have low overall
impact if it is poorly implemented. Process evaluation
studies allow for insight into how interventions and
the process of implementation can be optimized, to aid
future dissemination [ 24].
A suboptimal implementation might be one of the rea-
sons why the PACE Programme did not reach its intended
effects. Therefore, the aim of this process evaluation study
was to provide a more detailed understanding of the im-
plementation of the PACE Steps to Success Programme,
across countries and within specific countries. Specifically,
we sought to assess the programme ’sR e a c h ,A d o p t i o n ,
Implementation and the intention of staff to Maintain the
PACE Steps to Success Programme in future practice, and
the factors affecting these. The RE-AIM component
Effectiveness will not form part of this paper, since it has
already been examined separately and its results are re-
ported elsewhere [ 15].
Methods
Design
The process evaluation study systematically monitored
and evaluated the implementation of the PACE Steps
to Success Programme in 37 LTCFs across seven coun-
tries (see the study protocol for details on the trial de-
sign and sampling procedure [ 8]), according to the RE-
AIM framework [ 24]. The process evaluation started in
the pre-phase of the intervention and ended 18 months
after its start. Multiple methods —involving various
participants —were used, including structured diaries,
registries on training attendance and document adop-
tion, individual and group i nterviews and evaluation
questionnaires.
Data collection
Table 2provides an overview of the data collected in the
process evaluation, their correspondence with the RE-Oosterveld-Vlug et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:107 Page 3 of 19
AIM framework components and the criteria by which
they were rated.
To measure Reach , PACE coordinators used attend-
ance lists to register how many staff members attended
each training session, multi disciplinary review meeting
(step 3) or reflective debriefing session (step 6) until
month 18 of the intervention. In addition, to assess
Adoption , PACE coordinators reported on the number
of PACE documents (Looking and Thinking Aheaddocuments from step 1, and pain and depression as-
sessments from step 4) that were completed and ar-
chived at the end of the consolidation period (month
12). The extent to which the intervention was imple-
mented as intended was investigated by analysing
structured diaries that cou ntry trainers completed on a
weekly basis during the 12 months of the intervention,
in which they kept track of all the activities they
performed regarding the PACE Steps to SuccessTable 1 Definitions of RE-AIM dimensions

the PACE cluster randomized controlled trial.

Programme. Additionally, we examined the quality of
the training by involving the appreciation of care staff
members towards the p rogramme and trainer ’s teach-
ing competencies. Questions about their appreciation
were added to an evaluation questionnaire, which was
distributed to all care staff members after Step 6 of the
intervention (month 8). As we could not measure
Maintenance within the time scope of this research
project, the evaluation questionnaire also contained
questions on staff member ’sintention to maintain
elements and tools of the PACE Steps to Success
Programme in their future daily practice and whether
they would recommend the programme to other
LTCFs.
In order to gain insight into the factors that affected
the RE-AIM components, the facilitators and barriers
participants encountered during the implementation
period, and their recommendations for broader imple-
mentation or preferred adaptions to the programme,
semi-structured group interviews using a topic-list
were performed with car e staff members and PACE
coordinators, and individual interviews with facility
managers (month 13 –15). Researchers in each country
were trained in conducting these qualitative interviews
and were supported by the first and last authors (MOV
and HRP) during monthly online meetings. They were
instructed to take notice of the nursing home staff ’s
answers on the evaluation questionnaires, which were
collected a few months earlier, and prepare some tar-
geted questions that they could bring in if needed. The
interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim.
Lastly, country trainers were invited to attend one of
two online discussion group s (month 13). Organizing
discussion groups online has the advantage that partic-
ipants can easily join the discussion from anywhere at
any convenient time [ 25]. During a period of 15 days,
c o u n t r yt r a i n e r sw e r ea b l et ol o gi no nac l o s e dd i s c u s -
sion site and respond to the themes and questions.
The first author (MOV) functioned as moderator in
the group discussions and facilitated the discussions by
summarizing reactions, askin g additional questions to
clarify participants' view s if necessary and encouraging
participants to react on others ’comments.
Data analysis
Before the results were anal ysed, we established cri-
teria for high, medium and low levels of Reach, Adop-
tion, Implementation and intention to Maintenance
during a consensus meeting with the PACE consor-
tium, based on key elements of the PACE Programme.
For example, Reach was rated ‘high ’if the mean at-
tendance rate on all six training sessions was 70% or
higher, ‘medium ’if 30-69% and ‘low’if below 30%.
Cut-off scores for Adoption were somewhat higherthan for Reach, because we thought that higher rates
on Adoption would be more easily achievable in prac-
tice (see Table 2for the full list of criteria). Then, we
assessed how each LTCF within each country per-
formed on the different RE-AIM components.
The qualitative data gathered in the online discus-
sion groups and face-to-face (group) interviews were
analysed according to the principles of thematic
analysis [ 26], in a deductive way (i.e. framework
approach). In each country, two researchers read and
reread the transcripts of the (group) interviews in their
native language to become thoroughly familiar with
the data. They wrote extensi ve summaries including il-
lustrative quotes in English, facilitated by templates in
which topics were already pre-structured to some
extent. Analysis of the cross-country data described in
these summaries was done by three authors (MOV,
HRP and MtK) and then discussed with members of
the research team from all countries, in order to work
towards a consensus about interpretation of the key
findings.
Results
Participants
Table 3shows the number of different groups of par-
ticipants in the process evaluation study. In total, 16
country trainers were allocated to 37 intervention
LTCFs. They all participated in one of the online dis-
cussion groups. Of the 99 PACE coordinators
appointed in the LTCFs, 73 were interviewed in a total
of 25 group interviews. Also 151 care staff members
and 29 facility managers were interviewed.
Ratings on RE-AIM components
Figure 2shows the overall performance of the PACE
Steps to Success Programme on the different RE-AIM
components. According to the criteria we defined (see
Table 2), the levels to which the PACE Steps to Suc-
cess Programme were Implemented and intended to be
Maintained were generally higher than the levels to
which the PACE Programme Reached and was Adopted
by the target population. We will focus on each spe-
cific component below.
Reach
The mean attendance rate on all six training steps
varied widely between LTCFs, from 4% in one facility
in The Netherlands up to 81% in one facility in
Switzerland (see Figure 4 in Appendix ). A decrease in
attendance could be discerned over time. Across all 37
LTCFs, the mean attendance rate for step 1 was 55%
(median 58%, range 6-93%), for step 2 52% (median
52%, range 5-100%), for step 3 38% (median 38%, range
2-82%), for step 4 43% (median 42%, range 2-94%), forOosterveld-Vlug et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:107 Page 5 of 19
step 5 46% (median 42%, range 4-98%) and for step 6
39% (median 35%, range 1-93%). Figure 3shows that
attendance rates were highest in Finland and
Switzerland, and lowest in England. In total, 9 LTCFs
had a low level of Reach, 21 LTCFs a medium level of
Reach and 7 LTCFs a high level of Reach (see Fig. 2).
Factors affecting Reach
Qualitative information from the attendance lists,
group and individual interviews and online discussion
groups provided insight into the factors that both hin-
dered and facilitated attendance. First, the way the
training was organized influenced the level of attend-
ance. The attendance rate was likely to be highest if
training sessions were scheduled well in advance, at a
time of the day when most st aff could participate
(Table 4, Quote 1) and when no other meetings took
place simultaneously, and if sessions were widely com-
municated with enthusiasm by the PACE coordinator
or manager. In some LTCFs, the country trainer orga-
nized multiple sessions of the same PACE step, in-
creasing the possibility for staff to attend (Quote 2).
Other LTCFs chose to invite only those staff working
full-time, or only staff mem bers who had participatedin the first PACE training for the remainder of the
programme (Quote 3). These people were then trained
with the intention to spread the PACE Programme to
other staff members. Second, the availability of
personnel played a role in the level of attendance.
When LTCFs suffered from understaffing due to ill-
ness or holiday periods, only a small number of staff
members could be absent from the ward (Quote 4). At
these critical moments, attending the training con-
flicted with caring for residents. A third set of factors
concerned the motivation and expectations of staff .
Some staff members were very eager to learn more
about palliative care, others were barely interested.
Especially in times of reorganizations or when other
projects were ongoing or just finished, motivation to
attend training was found to be low, resulting in low
attendance. This motivation sometimes increased after
the first training session, b ecause discussing wishes for
future care with residents (Step 1) raised enthusiasm
among staff, making them curious about the remainder
of the PACE Programme (Quote 5). More often how-
ever, the attendance rate could also drop during the
PACE Programme because of expectations that were
not fulfilled (Quote 6), resistance to the trainer orTable 3 Overview of participants in process evaluation

when staff already had missed one of the former train-
ing sessions. Lastly, the qualitative information re-
vealed that attendance could be raised by certain
stimuli or incentives . For example, financial reimburse-
ment or the prospect of receiving a certificate for
attending a minimum of four training sessions
contributed to staff members ’attendance (Quote 7). In
some LTCFs, attending the training was compulsory.
This increased the attendance rate, but often had a
negative effect on staff members ’motivation and en-
thusiasm (Quote 8). A mana ger who encouraged staff
to attend the training, by giving them time off their
shifts, also helped in attaining a high level of reach.
Adoption
The proportion of residents with a completed Looking
and Thinking Ahead document (PACE step 1) archived
in the residents ’care file at the end of the consolida-
tion period ranged from 6% (LTCF in Italy) to 186%
(LTCF in The Netherlands) (see Figure 5 in Appendix ).
The latter high rate was caused by a high resident
turnover in this facility. O verall, adoption rates were
highest in Poland and lowest in England, but fluctu-
ated considerably within countries (Fig. 3). Applying
the rating criteria (see Table 2)r e s u l t e di n1 1L T C F s
with a low level of Adoption, 14 LTCFs with a mediumlevel of Adoption and 12 LTCFs with a high level of
Adoption (see Figure 2).
The proportion of residents for whom a pain and/or
depression assessment was completed was generally
much lower than the proportion of residents with a
completed Looking and Thinking Ahead document,
except for a few LTCFs in Italy and Switzerland. This
is because these assessment tools were presented as
optional within the PACE Pro gramme, i.e. pain assess-
ments were advised especially for new residents on
admission or for residents in pain, and depression
assessments only when a resident was observed to be
depressed. The proportion of residents with a pain
assessment (PACE step 4a) completed and docu-
mented at the end of the consolidation period ranged
from 0% (LTCFs in Belgium, The Netherlands and
England) to 135% (LTCF in Italy) (see Figure 6 in
Appendix ). The proportion of residents with a depression
assessment (PACE step 4b) completed and documented at
the end of the consolidation period ranged from 0%
(LTCFs in all countries except Finland and Poland) to
115% (LTCF in Poland) (see Figure 7 in Appendix ).
Factors affecting Adoption
The qualitative data shed light on the factors affecting the
level of Adoption. First, the content of the documents was

Availability of personnel (4)“I find that that the idea of doing sessions one staff at a time is great. But in
reality, come the day, you might have an incident going on and where we are
there is one nurse on the shop floor. And if you are that nurse and you are
attending that session something happens, it goes out the window. You are
either dealing with another professional who is come in doctor or whatever it is
or you are dealing with some other matter with relatives or client. That kind of
goes to pot a bit. ”PACE coordinator, England- Staffing problems
- Conflict ‘attending training vs. caring for residents ’
Motivation and expectations (5)“Especially after the first session, because before that it was a bit vague what
it entailed and what was expected from us and what is meant by this. But
especially after the first session I think everyone had an idea of it. I: Was that
helpful to increase motivation? R: It only increased after this session. ”Care staff,
Netherlands- Level of interest in palliative care
- Concurrence with other projects
- Change of motivation/enthusiasm during project
- Extent to which expectations are met (6) “When the training sessions started, it ’s true that we felt a weakening of the
staff’s motivation. Because there were things that have already been seen or
differently applied, because it mobilizes things we couldn ’t mobilize, in the way
they were set in the functioning. …It’s true, people expected something more
technical or more this or more that …And eventually they had something which
was not announced as such or defined as such. Consequently, they were
disappointed in regards of their expectations. ”PACE coordinator, Switzerland
Stimuli or incentives (7)“We also said that if you attend 4 of the 6 training sessions, you ’ll receive a
certificate. That helped, that really was to them …they really wanted that, to
receive a certificate, so that was a trigger. ”Manager, the Netherlands- Financial reimbursement
- Certificate (8) “They told us attending the course was obligatory. Some of the staff took this
very badly.
It isn ’t very stimulating if you have to attend even at your free days or
recuperation days. Especially if you don ’t know what the training will be about. ”
Care staff, Belgium- Extent to which training was compulsory

Content of documents (9)“And then there was that list, also a depression list …I: yes for people without
dementia..R: Yes everyone scored high on that one. And I think with those
questions ‘do you usually feel happy? And do you feel your life is empty? ’.
Everyone scored quite high on that, but then again there is a part of loneliness
and.. so I found that difficult, is this really added value? No I didn ’t find it [fit to
use here], at least we are not using it. “PACE coordinator, Netherlands- Language
- Applicability to LCTF population
- Perceived completeness
Organization of daily care practice (10)“We see each other almost every day, sometimes every two-three days, they

project was adopted for about 70%-80%. ”Manager, Italy- Extent to which use of tools was compulsory

Organizational issues (17) I had a very big problem with performing this Step (step 3) - in one LTCF
the staff deceived me several times in order to avoid the necessity of a staff
meeting, as well as discussing all residents. In the other one - the staff were
resistant in the accomplishment of earlier arrangements, contested them just
before starting, during or after the meetings. Country trainer, online discussion

Usefulness of PACE documents (21)“I am a big supporter of the multidisciplinary meetings and I absolutely
want that these stays implemented. Since PACE these meetings are organized
every month. I am always present during these meetings and I really think it is

way I am able to follow the condition of the resident ”. Manager, Belgium- Added value/changes to daily practice

not always experienced as simple, easily formulated and
applicable to the LTCF population (Quote 9). Second, fac-
tors related to the organization of daily care practice played
a role in the level of Adoption. For example, in LTCFs
where each staff member was responsible for the care of
one or a few residents, the discussion regarding wishes for
future care (step 1) was said to be easier, because a bond of
trust was often already estab lished between this staff
member and the resident (Quote 10). This bond of
trust was largely absent in LTCFs where nurses and
physicians were hired from external companies, or in
times of understaffing, when there is no time to sit and
get to know residents. Adopting the documents was
m a d ee a s i e ri nL T C F sw h e r et h e yw e r ei n c o r p o r a t e di n
each resident chart or made electronically available
(Quote 11). Also, staff members said they were more
inclined to complete the PACE documents when they
were already used to doing so, i.e. when their LTCF
already worked with similar documents for pain and
depression, or to engage in advance care planning
(ACP). However, when staff in a LCTF already worked
with documents already perceived to be of good qual-
ity, the PACE documents were evaluated as duplication
and causing a lot of extra work, resulting in resistance
of staff members to use the documents .T h el a r g e
amount of paperwork, in combination with the fact
that staff had little time to complete them and the doc-
uments not being electronically available, contributed
to this resistance, especially in older employees who
often showed little willingness to change their way of
working (Quote 12). Further more, some staff members
preferred to discuss pain or depression without an as-
sessment scale. Anxiety that everything is verifiable
played a role for a few. A more frequently mentioned
reason for resistance against the documents was that
care staff members did not feel skilled or competent
enough to assess pain or depression in residents
(Quote 13). They believed that each document should
be used by a professional on that domain; i.e. a social
worker for the ACP discussions (PACE Step 1), a
physiotherapist for the p ain assessments and a psych-
ologist or other physician for the depression assess-
ments (PACE Step 4). Also discussing death and dying
(Step 1) was often felt to be uncomfortable, especially
for care staff members in Poland and Italy, because of
a cultural taboo regarding these topics (Quote 14). But
also in other countries, sta ff members indicated that
they were not prepared to discuss these issues, ‘be-
cause they were trained to act instead of talk ’.O t h e r
factors influencing Adoption concerned the target
group of the documents: the residents, families and
their general practitioners (GPs). Barriers to adoption
were residents who were not willing or able to discuss
death (e.g. because of demen tia), little involvement offamilies in residents ’care, assumption s that residents
and family members expect staff members to enhance
the condition of a resident rather than talk about
death, and GPs who are not in favour of measuring
pain in a structured manner. In contrast, residents who
promoted ACP discussions among other residents,
family who were keen on such discussions and grateful
afterwards, and the experience that a pain scale facili-
tated communication with GPs helped in adopting the
tools (Quote 15). Lastly, the qualitative data revealed
that Adoption could be raised by certain stimuli from
others . For example, in a few LTCFs, completing the
documents was mandatory. In others, staff members
were actively reminded to use the tools or the manager
even announced that an audit would be performed
(Quote 16). An external stimulus in Belgium came
from the Flemish government, who reports the number
of documented ACP discussions as an indicator of the
q u a l i t yo fc a r ei naL T C F .
Implementation
The rating for Implementation consisted of two elements;
fidelity (the extent to which the six steps were delivered as
intended) and the care staffs ’appreciation of the trainer ’s
teaching competencies and the overall programme. First,
fidelity scores ranged from 5 to 8 (out of 8) and were gen-
erally high in all countries. The intervention was fully im-
plemented as intended in 28 out of 37 LCTFs in terms of
number, order and timing of training sessions; all six
PACE Steps were taught, in the right order and within 8
months. In seven other LTCFs (three in Belgium, three in
The Netherlands and one in England), the six PACE Steps
were taught, but not in the right order and/or not within
8 months. Only in two LTCFs (in Belgium and England)
were not all six PACE steps taught, but still training was
completed on five steps. Second, the combined score for
satisfaction with the trainer ’s teaching competencies and
with the overall PACE Programme ranged, on a scale from
0-8, from 3.2 (LTCF in Finland) to 7.8 (LTCF in Poland)
(see Figures 8 and 9 in Appendix ). Overall, the satisfaction
scores were highest in England and The Netherlands and
lowest in Finland and Belgium.
Combining the satisfaction scores with fidelity shows
that only 2 LTCFs in Finland scored low, 24 LTCFs
medium and 11 LTCFs high regarding level of Imple-
mentation (see Figures 2and3).
Factors affecting Implementation
T h eq u a l i t a t i v ed a t as h o w e dt h a t organizational issues
could be reasons for the fidelity not always being
maximal, such as PACE coordinators being absent or
unreachable, or too many people who must gather to-
gether for the multidiscipl inary review meetings, which
made it difficult to schedule appointments (Quote 17).Oosterveld-Vlug et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:107 Page 10 of 19
In addition, scheduled meetings were sometimes can-
celled due to illness among staff or due to the LTCF
being placed in quarantine because of a viral outbreak
in the LTCF. Regarding the characteristics of the PACE
trainer , we found that satisfaction among staff mem-
bers was higher when the trainer had experience in
palliative care, so that he/she could incorporate exam-
ples from his/her own practice and understood what
was relevant in daily practice. Experience in teaching
was also considered crucial (Quote 18 and 19), since
the teaching style of some trainers was perceived as
too simplistic and did not engage staff, thus decreasing
motivation to attend training sessions. Also, character-
istics of the training programme influenced the satisfac-
tion of staff members. Some felt the time between
training sessions was too long, for instance because
they had forgotten what was discussed with the previ-
ous step, while others experienced it as too short with
more time being needed to digest all the information
before continuing with another subject in another step
(Quote 20). Remarks were also made on the number
and length of each training session.
Intention to Maintenance
The rating for Maintenance is a combination of both the
manager ’s and the care staffs ’intention to continue
working with PACE steps and tools. Managers of 26
LTCFs stated in the interviews that they were willing to
continue with PACE in their own LTCF. The other
managers had no intention to continue with PACE
(managers of five LCTFs) or declined to be interviewed
(managers of six LTCFs) which we also interpreted as
‘having no intention to work with PACE anymore ’.
The score for staff member ’s intention to work with
PACE steps/documents in the future, together with their
recommendation regarding PACE to other LTCFs
ranged, on a scale from 0 to 8, from 2.5 (LTCF in
Poland) to 7.9 (LTCF in England) (see Figure 10 in
Appendix ). Combining the scores for manager ’s and care
staff members ’intentions resulted in the ratings shown
in Figs. 2and3; 3 LTCFs scored low, 12 LTCFs medium,
and 22 LTCFs high regarding intention to Maintenance.
Factors affecting Intention to Maintenance
The qualitative data revealed why managers and care
staff did or did not intend to work with PACE in the
future. A first set of reasons were related to the useful-
ness of the PACE documents . Reasons to continue with
PACE were that working a ccording to PACE brought
added value to practice (e.g. more awareness for spir-
ituality, opening the discussion about the taboo on
death, mindfulness of resident ’s needs, less burnout
among staff) (Quote 21), whereas reasons to quit were
the high workload, the large number of documents, thepreference for other or no documents at all or the
PACE documents being viewed as not clear and not
simple enough for severely demented residents (Quote
22). Secondly, the future availability of PACE coordi-
nators played a role in the intention of managers and
staff to continue with PACE (Quote 23 and 24).
Appointing staff who would be responsible for the
continuation of PACE was regarded as important.
However, this was difficult in some LTCFs, as PACE
coordinators were not always committed to consoli-
date PACE, no longer working in the facility or
blocked by unsupportive fellow staff members in per-
forming their tasks. In some other LTCFs, the enthusi-
asm for PACE faded after the trainer had left the
LTCF, leaving no-one to organize any follow-up.
Lastly, aspects around the organization and policy of
the LTCF influenced the intention to continue with
PACE. Changes within management or minimal in-
volvement of the management in PACE was found to
hinder its maintenance. In another instance, the size of
the LTCF was found too large to facilitate the continu-
ation of PACE. In contrast, having a budget available
to further roll out PACE or having worked already on
the electronic availability of the PACE tools within the
residents ’care plans, helped to maintain PACE (Quote
25). Specifically in England, being able to use the
PACE Programme in care home i nspection registration
and to help nurses revalidate their registration were
mentioned as factors positively influencing the main-
tenance of PACE (Quote 26).
Country-specific challenges in implementing PACE
Some country-specific challenges in implementing the
PACE Programme were identified. For example, in
Poland, LTCFs are characterized by a strong sense of
hierarchy between the diffe rent professions and a clear
determination of fields of e xpertise and division of
tasks (hygiene, psychological well-being, medical con-
dition, physiotherapy, social issues). Being ‘task ori-
ented ’made it more difficult to embrace the steps that
required a holistic approach to residents. In addition,
in Poland as well as in Italy, prevailing cultural taboos
on discussing death impacted on staffs ’ability to im-
plement the steps. Limited knowledge on palliative
care was especially seen in Italy, where palliative care
was often equated with euthanasia or seen as an ap-
proach only belonging to cancer patients and hospice
care; some doctors therefore refused to take notice of
the PACE Programme. In Finland and Switzerland, the
PACE Programme was —m o r eo f t e nt h a ni nt h eo t h e r
countries —perceived as to not fit the level of know-
ledge and needs of the facilit y and the nurses. Staff in-
dicated that a good level of palliative care was already
established in their facility and that they did not learnOosterveld-Vlug et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:107 Page 11 of 19
that much from the PACE Programme. Instead, they
had hoped for a more techni cal training. In England in
particular, the attendance rates on the training sessions
were low. The long shifts that some staff members
worked here (up to 12 h) created difficulties for them
to attend training sessions or made staff members
openly admit that they would not come to training on
their day off. Some LTCFs therefore had requested the
country trainer to shorten the training sessions to 45
min, so that staff could rotate to access training ses-
sions in normal working hours, or to give one-on-one
training sessions. In the Netherlands and Belgium, re-
organizations and transformations of residential care
homes into nursing homes were every day ’sb u s i n e s s ,
causing anxiety and instabi lity within teams. On top of
that, in a few Belgian LTCFs, there was a tense atmos-
phere between PACE coordinators (often head nurses)
and palliative care specialist nurses, who were per-
ceived to be jealous because they believed palliative
care was only their specialty. Palliative care specialist
nurses did sometimes not attend training and were in
return not invited by PACE coordinators to multidis-
ciplinary review meetings. Lastly, a specific challenge
encountered in the Netherlands was working together
with a large number of GPs. The fact that the Dutch
country trainers were GPs themselves helped some-
what to convince GPs to attend the multidisciplinary
review meetings in the LTCF.
Discussion
The aim of this process evaluation study was to provide
a more detailed understanding of the implementation of
the PACE Steps to Success Programme, across countries
and within specific countries. By examining its Reach,
Adoption, Implementation and intention to Mainten-
ance, we have shown that the performance of the PACE
Programme on the different components was highly
variable within and across countries, with generally a
better performance on the components Implementation
and Maintenance than on the components Reach and
Adoption. Our study sheds light on areas where subopti-
mal implementation of the PACE Programme may have
led to limited effects found in the PACE trial, as well as
helps to better understand the optimal levels of training
and facilitation and provides recommendations to im-
prove implementation in the complex LTC setting.
Process evaluation findings in relation to intervention
effectiveness
Whereas the interplay of several factors within all RE-
AIM components should be taken into account when
explaining why the PACE Programme did not reach its
intended effects within the trial [ 15], the process evalu-
ation study provided clues to assume that particularlythe suboptimal level of Reach contributed to the lack
of (clinically relevant) effects that were found on the
primary outcomes. Our analysis revealed a decreasing
trend in attendance over time; with a mean attendance
rate of 55% on step 1 and 39% on step 6, implying that
many care staff members were insufficiently reached in
order to enhance their palliative care knowledge level
to a relevant degree. In addition, the finding that resi-
dent ’s comfort in the last week of life did not improve
by the PACE Programme might have been the result of
a relatively low attendance rate on step 5, the step that
particularly concerned t he management of symptoms
in the last days of life. In contrast, the finding that the
secondary resident outcome ‘quality of care in the last
month of life ’—with the subscales ‘personhood ’,‘pre-
paratory tasks ’and ‘closure ’—did improve significantly
seems to be result of a higher attendance rate on the
first step of the PACE Programme. This first step of
the PACE Programme concerned ACP conversations
and brought about a conversational shift in LTCFs
around the end of life. Moreover, being the first step, it
was implemented for the longest period of time.
Factors affecting RE-AIM components and
recommendations to improve implementation
All factors that we found to affect the different RE-AIM
components could be classified into three major categor-
ies, namely (1) the PACE Programme itself and its way
of delivery, (2) people working with the PACE
Programme, and (3) contextual factors. The first
category entails factors like the high amount of paper-
work, the time between training sessions, the vocabulary
used in the PACE documents and the practical experi-
ence of the trainer and his/her way of teaching. Accord-
ing to our process evaluation, key recommendations for
future implementation are to reduce the amount of
paperwork (e.g. by making the tools electronically avail-
able), to allow a flexible length of time between training
sessions, to provide clear materials and to ensure that
trainers are well qualified in palliative care as well as
teaching (see Table 5). The second category is about fac-
tors concerning people working with the PACE
Programme, i.e. managers, PACE coordinators and staff
members. The process evaluation revealed that the in-
volvement and support of the facility manager is essen-
tial for a good level of implementation. Managers can
free up time for PACE coordinators so that they can do
their tasks, stimulate motivation and attendance of staff
members to training sessions (e.g. by giving them an in-
centive in the form of payment or certificate) and often
decide whether they want to invest in resources (budget
and personnel) for consolidation. It is therefore import-
ant to involve the manager throughout the entire period
of implementing the PACE Programme, and not only atOosterveld-Vlug et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:107 Page 12 of 19
the start of the project. PACE coordinators have to be
chosen carefully and must have enough time, motiv-
ation, access to colleagues and capabilities to role model
the programme. Finally, there were a number of context-
ual factors that influenced the implementation of PACE.
Factors from within the LTCF, such as staff turnover,
changes within the organization, upcoming inspection
visits, other competing projects, or working with
personnel hired from external companies affected the di-
verse RE-AIM dimensions. For future implementation, it
is recommended to carefully determine the start of the
programme, so as to avoid the implementation of other
innovations at the same time and starting with an un-
stable team. It is also recommended that the current
level of palliative care knowledge and practice within a
LTCF is taken into account, so that the PACE
Programme can be tailored to the specific context of a
country or setting where possible. This means allowing
some flexibility in content and timing of the programme
steps, and integrating the PACE Programme into existing
procedures and documentation. Contextual factors from
outside the LTCF affecting the implementation included
multiple GP involvement and a lack of interest in palliative
care, and a cultural taboo on discussing death and dying.
Bringing about change in these factors requires a long-
term effort and considerable support.
The three categories described above largely corres-
pond with the domains in the Consolidated Framework
For Implementation Research (CFIR) [ 27], with the
first category ‘the PACE Programme itself and its way
of delivery ’mapping onto the CFIR domain ‘character-
istics of the intervention ’(e.g. perceived excellence in
how the intervention is bundled, presented and assem-
bled), the second category ‘people working with the
PACE Programme ’mapping onto the CFIR domain
‘characteristics of individuals ’(e.g. Individuals' atti-
tudes towards and value placed on the Intervention),
and the third category ‘contextual factors ’mapping
onto the two CFIR domains ‘inner setting (e.g. leader-
ship engagement and available resources) and outer
setting ’(e.g. external policies and incentives).
These are not isolated categories, but interrelate with
each other in a way that corresponds to the findings
from a realist process evaluation within the Facilitating
Implementation of Resear ch Evidence (FIRE) studyperformed in care homes [ 28]. This study suggested an
interplay between mechanisms relating to the align-
ment and fit of the intervention with staff members ’
needs, expectations and work s etting, prioritization of
the topic of the intervention and engagement of staff
with the intervention, whic h, in combination, influ-
enced staff ’s ability to learn over time and ultimately
implement practice changes [ 28]. Indeed, we found
that the level of implementation was largely dependent
on whether LTCFs prioritized their involvement in the
PACE programme, which included release of resources
(e.g. dedicated time for PACE coordinators, budget to
reimburse staff attending training) and other forms of
managerial support, often resulting in collective en-
gagement and motivation of staff to develop their roles
around palliative care.
Implementing a complex intervention in multiple
complex contexts
Although the barriers and facilitators we identified
may not be all novel [ 29], and most of them were even
taken into account before we started the trial (e.g. we
defined a set of criteria for the selection of country
trainers and PACE coordinat ors, we tried to motivate
managers and deliver clear materials), the practicalities
of realizing them still appeared to be a challenge (e.g.
identifying and retaining persons who fitted the selec-
tion criteria and stayed in post for the duration of the
study, translating and culturally adapting a programme
that is originally from England). The nursing home
context is described as a particularly difficult one in
which to implement change and improvement, because
of issues related to staff turnover, high workload, low
numbers of registered nurses and an institutional
environment that continually shifts and transforms
[29,30]. The international scope of the study added
another layer of complexity. As described, country-
specific as well as facility-specific challenges were
omnipresent. Nevertheless, despite wide variations in
organization, funding and typologies of LTCFs across
the seven counties [ 31,32], the implementation of the
PACE Steps to Success Programme appeared to be
feasible in all of them.
Our implementation activities were shaped and to
some extent constrained because the PACE Steps toTable 5 Key recommendations to improve future implementation of PACE Steps to Success Programme

Success intervention was tested in a cluster random-
ized controlled trial, in which there was limited space
for flexibility to adapt the PACE Programme to the
specific context [ 8]. However, for implementation to
be successful, the Promoting Action on Research Im-
plementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework
argues that a balance is required between the evidence
incorporated within an inte rvention, the context in
which it is implemented and the degree of facilitation
provided [ 33–35]. Likewise, in recent years, a debate
has arisen on whether the focus of care practice should
shift from ‘evidence-based practice ’towards a more
‘context-based practice ’, in which evidence is regarded
as only one of the sources to shape practice, among
others [ 36]. Chances for sustainable implementation of
the PACE Steps to Success Programme might therefore
increase if it follows the Dynamic Sustainability Frame-
work that proposes continued learning and problem
solving, ongoing adaptation of interventions with a pri-
mary focus on the fit between interventions and multi-
level contexts, and expectations for ongoing improvement
as opposed to diminishing outcomes over time [ 37].
Closely monitoring the fit between the programme and
the context, as well as monitoring the adaptations made to
the programme and attempting to understand why they
occurred and how they may influence the functioning of
the intervention is important in further guiding the dis-
semination of the PACE Programme [ 23]. In addition, it is
important to ensure that the programme remains consist-
ent with its underlying theories. This corresponds with an
approach often heard in the ‘fidelity-adaptation debate ’—a
debate that is increasingly recognized within implementa-
tion research studies of complex interventions where con-
text is an important mediating factor —stating that it may
be more helpful to reframe the idea of fidelity away from
adherence to delivery of all intervention components to-
wards alignment with theories underpinning the interven-
tion [ 23,30,38]. This approach provides a more flexible
framework for assessing fidelity, and includes being able
to contextualize an intervention to specific circumstances
while still being faithful to its underlying theory [ 21].
Methodological considerations
Very few published examples of process evaluation stud-
ies examining the implementation of palliative care pro-
grammes in nursing homes exist, and none at the scale
of this study set in multiple country contexts. Major
strengths of our process evaluation study were that it
was set up using a rigorous study design, embedded
within the PACE cluster randomized controlled trial and
performed in a similar manner in seven countries.
Whereas the implementation of most interventions,
including the implementation of the precursor of the
PACE Programme —the Six Steps to SuccessProgramme —are evaluated in a less robust way [ 11,39],
we gained an in-depth understanding of the functioning
of the PACE Steps to Success Programme, from a variety
of perspectives and countries. Whereas other studies
sometimes only report ‘fidelity ’as a single measure for
degree of overall implementation, we structured our
process evaluation according to the RE-AIM framework
which enabled us to capture a more complete picture.
Although many approaches to evaluation of intervention
implementation exist, we considered the RE-AIM frame-
work to be the best fit, because it clearly acknowledges
that each RE-AIM dimension provides a target for the
intervention. However, the RE-AIM framework also has
its limitations, one being that it is initially developed to
assess the implementation of complex public health in-
terventions rather than being specific to LTCFs; there-
fore, we slightly adapted the framework to fit this
specific context. This also entailed that we applied differ-
ent cut-off scores for level of Reach and Adoption, based
on the perceived degree of achievability in practice. The
consequence though is that the results on these two RE-
AIM are not easily comparable.
The large amount of information we collected posed
challenges on the key informants of the PACE trial,
who indicated they were overburdened by all PACE re-
lated activities (the intervention and the research),
which might have decreased their enthusiasm for the
PACE Programme. To reduce the workload of PACE
coordinators, we chose to provide attendance lists that
only asked for the number of care staff members at-
tending each session and the total number of care staff
members working in the LTCF at that moment. How-
ever, this compromised our ability to describe whether
the participants were representative for the total mix
of care staff members working in the LTCF and our
ability to describe whether the same individuals
attended several sessions or not. To be able to reflect
on whether over-representation of certain groups and
under-representation of others, as well as degree of
consistency of attendance over time may have affected
the implementation process and intervention success,
we would recommend a more extensive examination of
Reach in future studies.
Conclusion
The implementation of the PACE Steps to Success
Programme was feasible, but also highly variable within
and across countries. The results of the process evalu-
ation will be used to further adapt and improve the
PACE Steps the Success Programme before its further
dissemination. We recommend that future implementa-
tion of the PACE Programme is guided by close and
ongoing monitoring of the fit between the programme
and the context.Oosterveld-Vlug et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:107 Page 14 of 19

Netherlands, PL Poland, EN England, CH Switzerland. < 40% = Low, 40 –79 % = Medium, ≥80% = High. Notes: (1) For 1 LTCF in The Netherlands,
no report was received from the PACE coordinator, but the level of Adoption could be estimated as Low, based on information from the (group)
interviews. (2) Due to high resident turnover the proportion in some LTCFs exceeds 100% as it was calculated as ‘number of residents with
document divided by number of beds ’Fig. 4 Mean attendance rates per LTCF (Reach). BE Belgium, FI Finland, IT Italy, NL The Netherlands, PL Poland, EN England, CH Switzerland.
< 30% = Low, 30 –69% = Medium, ≥70% = High. Note: For 2 LTCFs in Belgium, not all 6 attendance lists were received from the PACE
coordinator, but their level of Reach could be estimated as Medium, based on the attendance lists we did receive, information from the country
trainer and from the (group) interviews.Oosterveld-Vlug et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:107 Page 15 of 19
