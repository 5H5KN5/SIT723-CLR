Abstract 
Background: Having a stammer can have a significant effect on a child’s social, emotional and educational devel-
opment. With approximately 66,000 children in the UK having a stammer, there is a need to establish an adequate 
evidence base to inform clinical practice. We describe a feasibility trial to explore the effectiveness of a new therapy 
programme for children aged 8–14: Palin Stammering Therapy for School Children (Palin STSC(8–14)). Preliminary 
data from the Michael Palin Centre, where the programme was developed, indicate that Palin STSC(8–14) is effective 
in reducing stammering frequency and impact for children, with beneficial effects for parents too. We will investigate 
the feasibility of the methods required for a definitive randomised controlled trial to investigate the application of this 
therapy by NHS speech and language therapists (SLTs), compared with ‘treatment as usual’ (TAU), beyond the special-
ist context in which it was developed.
Methods: This is a two-arm feasibility cluster-randomised controlled trial of Palin STSC(8–14) with TAU control arm, 
and randomisation at the level of the SLT. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected to examine the follow-
ing: the recruitment and retention of therapists and families, the acceptability of the research processes and the 
therapeutic intervention and the appropriateness of the therapy outcome measures. Assessments will be completed 
by children and parents at baseline and 6 months later, including measures of stammering severity; the impact of 
child’s stammering on both children and parents; child temperament, behaviour and peer relations, anxiety; quality 
of life; and economic outcomes. There will also be a qualitative process evaluation, including interviews with parents, 
children, SLTs and SLT managers to explore the acceptability of both the research and therapy methods. Treatment 
fidelity will be examined through analysis of therapy session records and recordings.
Discussion: The findings of this feasibility trial will inform the decision as to whether to progress to a full-scale 
randomised controlled trial to explore the effectiveness of Palin STSC(8–14) when compared to Treatment as Usual in 
NHS SLT services. There is a strong need for an evidence-based intervention for school age children who stammer.

Background
Stammering (also known as stuttering) is a speech dis -
order that is overtly characterised by difficulties in start -
ing, repeating, or prolonging a word or syllable [1]. The 
speech disruption may also be accompanied by a number 
of physical behaviours, including facial tension and gri -
maces, rapid eye blinks and tightness in the upper body 
[1, 2]. However, it is the less observable features of the 
disorder which have a greater impact on day-to-day func -
tioning and participation.
Having a stammer can have a significant effect on a 
child’s confidence, self-esteem and emotional state [3] 
and is associated with a significantly heightened inci -
dence of anxiety disorders [4]. When persistent, as the 
stammering continues into school age and adolescence, 
attitudes towards speech and communication become 
increasingly negative and the ability to function in eve -
ryday speaking situations decreases [5]. School-aged chil -
dren who stammer are more likely to be rejected, bullied 
and perceived negatively compared to their normally flu -
ent peers and are more likely to have difficulties estab -
lishing friendships with peers than children who do not 
stammer [6]. Stammering not only has an impact on the 
child who is stammering, but also affects the parents who 
express feelings of worry, anxiety, uncertainty, frustra -
tion, upset and self-blame [7]. Interactions and relation -
ships between parents and child can also be affected [8].
While stammering is present in all age groups, research 
indicates that most children who stammer begin to do 
so before adolescence, generally between 2 and 5 years 
of age [9]. For some, the experience is transient, but 
where the stammering persists beyond 18 months post 
onset or beyond 7 years of age, it becomes increasingly 
likely that the condition will be chronic [9]. According 
to the Department for Education (2012) [10], there are 
6,614,230 children in state-funded primary and second -
ary schools in England. Based on a prevalence figure of 
1% [9], this means that there are estimated to be over 
66,000 school aged children in the UK with a chronic 
stammer.
In order to improve a person’s quality of life, emotional 
well-being, social integration, educational attainment and 
occupational potential, it is critical to provide effective 
and timely intervention. Providing effective intervention 
in the school age years has the potential to reduce the 
emotional and economic consequences of stammering 
in the adult years. Baxter et al. [11] carried out an NIHR 
HTA-funded systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions for stammering published from 1990 to 
2014. From the 112 papers included, only seven were 
randomised controlled trials and none focused on 
school-aged children, the focus of our study. There were 
studies identified for this age, reporting cross-sectional 
and uncontrolled trials, but there has been no prospec -
tive randomised controlled trial investigating therapy 
with school-aged children.
There are some quasi-experimental trials and reports 
of intervention outcomes in the literature. For instance, 
there is early evidence for the use of an operant-based 
intervention approach (the Lidcombe Program) [12], 
syllable-timed speech [13], and prolonged speech, 
delayed auditory feedback and gradual increase of 
length and complexity of utterance [14]. These are all 
speech restructuring or fluency enhancing behavioural 
approaches to intervention and consequently stammer -
ing frequency was the single outcome measure. How -
ever, there are a number of challenges to the ecological 
validity of stammering frequency as the primary outcome 
measure. Firstly, production of relatively fluent speech 
using a technique in a test situation does not necessarily 
reflect generalisation to other contexts or habituation of 
the skill, and there is little evidence that children main -
tain or indeed generalise any new speech restructuring 
method beyond the clinic context. Secondly, increased 
fluency is not the only, nor indeed the most important, 
outcome from therapy for children who stammer or their 
parents [15, 16]. And thirdly, although empirical evi -
dence to support a comprehensive approach is awaited, 
there is a growing consensus of opinion that therapy 
should address the cognitive and affective components of 
the disorder (such as speech related anxiety, frustration, 
reduced confidence and self-esteem), in order to advance 
the ability to communicate and participate in daily speak -
ing situations [17].
In addition to the paucity of empirical research, ser -
vices to children who stammer are affected by inequita -
ble, inefficient and inadequate services for children with 
speech, language and communication needs [18]. SLTs 
report reduced knowledge, skills and confidence to work 
with this client group in particular [19]. The combined 
effect of all these factors means that services to children 
who stammer are described as ‘a post-code lottery’ , with 
variability in the content, frequency, context, quality and 
availability of the intervention available [20].
While there are a small number of specialist centres 
(e.g. Michael Palin Centre) where children may be able Keywords: Stammering, Therapy, School-aged children, Feasibility, Randomised controlled trial, Usual treatment,

to receive some support when no local support is avail -
able, these do not have the capacity to meet the need on 
a national basis. The current literature shows there is 
a clear need for evidence-based interventions targeting 
school-age children which can be delivered by speech 
and language therapists within local  services. In order 
to improve services for children who stammer, further 
empirical evidence for interventions and increased 
training for speech and language therapists is required.
This feasibility study will explore potential challenges 
and aims to establish the viability of a large scale ran -
domised controlled trial to explore the effectiveness 
and cost-effectiveness of Palin STSC(8–14) as a therapy 
to meet the needs of children, parents and SLTs. Three 
preliminary studies have been conducted to estab -
lish initial efficacy of Palin STSC(8–14) [21– 23] at 
the Michael Palin Centre. Two describe the outcomes 
of the therapy delivered during a 2-week intensive 
group therapy course, with 1-year follow-up data com -
pared to a pre-therapy baseline phase [21, 22]. A third 
explored the efficacy of Palin STSC(8–14) when deliv -
ered through weekly, individual family sessions [23]. All 
studies reported a reduction in stammering frequency, 
a reduction in the impact of stammering on the chil -
dren and reduced parental worry which was main -
tained for one year post therapy. Parents also reported 
increased knowledge and confidence to manage the 
disorder.
These studies indicate the efficacy of this integrated 
therapy approach when delivered in a specialist context, 
by therapists who developed the programme and who 
work with it frequently and intensively with high lev -
els of training and supervision. There has been no study 
to investigate whether this approach can be taught to, 
and utilised by, speech and language therapists work -
ing outside this context, to improve the lives of children 
who stammer and their parents. There is no evidence to 
inform whether this intervention is any more effective or 
cost-effective than current SLT practices.
This article reports the protocol (V5 16.09.2021) 
which includes amendments introduced as a result of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of procedures and 
methods were altered from the original protocol so that 
all aspects of the trial could be conducted remotely. 
These amendments were introduced in order to reduce 
the requirement for face-to-face contact between 
researchers, SLTs and families, thereby reducing the risk 
of infection and protecting the trial as far as possible 
from the impact of future ‘lockdowns’ . Since the onset of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, the staff at the Michael Palin 
Centre have demonstrated that Palin STSC(8–14) can 
be delivered via an on-line platform. While it is too early 
to evaluate the outcomes of this method of delivery, the feedback from both therapists and clients has been very 
positive.
Aims and objectives
The effectiveness of Palin STSC(8–14) in comparison to 
local services Treatment as Usual will not be assessed in 
this trial. The aim of this study is to establish the feasi -
bility of a future definitive randomised controlled trial to 
inform progression to a full-scale trial and indicate any 
necessary adjustments (changes to procedures, outcome 
measures, data collection methods, intervention delivery, 
etc.). This study has the following feasibility objectives:
Objective 1: To determine whether sufficient num -
bers of SLTs, children and parents can be recruited 
(via NHS trusts) and retained for a future trial, con -
sidering participation, dropout and completion rates.
Objective 2: To examine the range and complete -
ness of the measures used to measure and predict 
response to treatment. The variability and within 
cluster (SLT) correlation will be considered with 
respect to power calculations for the full trial.
Objective 3: To evaluate the acceptability of Palin 
STSC(8–14) to children, speech and language thera -
pists and parents.
Objective 4: To evaluate the acceptability of the 
research methods, including randomisation and 
data collection.
Objective 5: To evaluate treatment fidelity, based 
on adherence to the therapy programme, by SLTs 
through quantitative and qualitative assessments. To 
do this, it will be necessary to develop a treatment 
fidelity checklist and intervention monitoring docu -
mentation.
Objective 6: To explore the feasibility of collecting 
health economic data.
Method
Design
The design is a two-arm cluster-randomised controlled 
trial with randomisation at the level of the speech and 
language therapist. Randomisation at the level of the 
child is not possible due to the number of factors beyond 
the control of the researchers, which affect whether a 
specific child is able to access a particular service, loca -
tion or clinical context (e.g. geographical distance to 
clinic, service organisation requirements, funding). The 
sites serve populations that are diverse in terms of socio-
economic status, rural vs urban, education levels and eth -
nicity. Randomising at the level of SLT rather than site is 
intended to maximise the chance that demographic vari -
ables will be spread evenly across the intervention groups 
Page 4 of 14 Millard et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:210 
and so SLT randomisation will be stratified by site. There 
will be three participant groups: speech and language 
therapists, parent-child dyads and SLT managers of ser -
vices that are participating.
Participating SLTs allocated to the intervention arm 
will deliver Palin STSC(8–14) and those allocated to the 
control arm will deliver the usual intervention provided 
to school-aged children who stammer within that NHS 
service. SLTs allocated to the Palin STSC(8–14) arm will 
receive training in the approach immediately. It is possi -
ble that their approach to children who stammer will be 
influenced by this training and so those SLTs allocated to 
the treatment as usual control arm will have the option 
to attend training after all study measures have been 
completed. Potential child participants will be identi -
fied by SLTs and will receive intervention based on their 
assigned SLTs allocation.
Children and parents will complete questionnaires at 
baseline and again 6 months later (see Fig.  1). SLTs com -
plete a questionnaire at the start and end of their involve -
ment in the trial. In addition, semi-structured interviews 
with a purposive sample of SLTs, parents, children and 
SLT managers will be conducted at the start and end 
of the trial (all groups) and at the end of therapy (chil -
dren, parents and SLTs). This trial protocol is in line with 
Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Inter -
ventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 (see SPIRIT checklist in 
Additional file 1).
Setting
This is a multi-site trial. NHS speech and language ther -
apy services in England and Wales which offer, or which 
have potential to offer, therapy to children who stammer 
aged 8–14 can take part in the study.
Intervention
Since the onset of the pandemic in March 2019, there 
has been an increase in access to services through tele -
health. To reflect this change, either intervention may be 
accessed during face-to-face appointments or via a video 
platform.
Treatment as usual
There is no defined or accepted standard practice for 
this client group and little evidence of what constitutes 
Treatment as Usual and so the intervention that children 
receive will vary across services. It may include generalist 
therapy, group therapy, reviews of progress, referral to a 
specialist service or no treatment at all. It is anticipated 
that the goals and content of therapy will also differ and 
may include general advice, fluency strategies, stammer -
ing modification, confidence speaking and/or increased 
environmental support.Palin stammering therapy for school children (8–14)
The primary aim of the intervention is for the child to 
become a more confident and effective communicator. In 
order to achieve this, the following goals are targeted:
• Maximising the child’s fluency and/or reducing 
struggle speaking
• Enhancing communication skills in the family
• Increasing confidence and participation in speaking 
situations
• Reducing child’s and parents’ worry about stammer -
ing
• Developing parents’ skills and confidence to support 
the child
Sessions start with a Solution Focused Brief Therapy 
session to explore goals and expectations from therapy 
[24]. Therapy focuses on the development of skills across 
three main areas: (1) family communication skills, (2) 
strategies to address the cognitive/emotional needs and 
(3) direct fluency work. The approach assumes that the 
child is only able to make changes in these areas with 
the support and input of at least one parent/carer and 
so they are involved in the therapy throughout. Palin 
STSC(8–14) comprises 10 sessions, as this ‘dosage’ level 
was shown to be efficacious in our preliminary study [23].
Participants
There are three groups of participants: SLTs who deliver 
the intervention, parent and child dyads and SLT man -
agers. No formal sample size calculation was carried out. 
For the purposes of this study we have used the availa -
ble literature and discussions with local SLT services to 
provide some estimations of recruitment and response 
rates.  We seek to recruit a total of 30 SLTs to the trial 
(i.e. 15 per intervention arm), with each therapist pro -
viding on average 2 children (and no more than 4). We 
aim to recruit in total 60 children who stammer between 
the ages of 8 and 14. With the expectation of attrition 
of around 20%, this would result in a total of around 
50 completers. We will recruit 4-6 SLT managers to be 
interviewed.
Recruitment
SLTs:  SLTs will be recruited from NHS speech and lan -
guage therapy services who receive referrals for children 
who stammer and are aged between 8 and 14 years old. 
The services can be located anywhere within England or 
Wales in line with the trial’s ethical approvals from the 
Health Research Authority.

 Millard et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:210 
 
SLTs will be made aware of the study through per -
sonal contact, social media posts, notifications through 
Clinical Research Networks, SLT special interest groups and through the Royal College of Speech and Language 
Therapists. No previous expertise or experience in stam -
mering is required. SLTs and managers will be sent SLT Fig. 1 Standard Protocol Items for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments for Palin STSC(8–14) feasibility

participant information sheets and a trial summary in 
response to any expression of interest.
Child and Parent participants:  The participating SLTs 
will be responsible for identifying eligible children who 
are on the caseload or who are referred to their service 
for stammering intervention. Figure  2 summarises the process of recruitment and participation for children 
and parents. Once identified by a SLT, the parent will 
be approached by the SLT to be told about the service’s 
involvement in the trial and to request their consent to 
be contacted by the study research team. The study team 
will then contact the parent to screen for eligibility and 
initiate the informed consent process. The Participant 
information sheets, for both children and parents, as well

as copies of the consent and assent forms will be sent for 
consideration and 2 weeks will be given for the family to 
consider participating.
SLT Managers: A purposive sample of 4-6 managers of 
services that are participating in the trial will be invited 
to take part in semi-structured interviews.
Consenting
SLTs:  SLTs will be offered time with the research team to 
discuss the trial and to ask questions. If the SLT wishes to 
proceed and the service manager supports this, then the 
research team will liaise with the local R&D team to open 
the trial at that site. SLT consent will be taken remotely 
via the trial database.
Children and parents: At the end of a 2-week consider -
ation period, the family will be contacted by the research 
team to provide an opportunity to ask questions. The 
parent consent form and child assent form will be com -
pleted remotely via the database.
Inclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria for each participant group is as 
follows:
SLTs :
• Not currently delivering Palin STSC(8–14) and 
not previously trained in the approach
• Have the potential to identify and provide inter -
vention (either Palin STSC(8–14) or Treatment as 
Usual) to at least 2 children within the duration of 
the study.
Children:
• Aged between 8 years 0 months and 14 years 11 
months at the start of the study
• Diagnosed/recognised as stammering by speech 
and language therapist, parent and self.
• Want to receive stammering therapy
• Have at least one parent who is able to attend ther -
apy and participate in the study
Parents:
• Have a child who is participating in the study
SLT managers:
• Have management responsibility for the SLTs 
involved in the study
• Had a role in the decision about whether the ser -
vice would take part in the trialExclusion criteria
SLTs :
• Currently working with families on a weekly basis 
using principles of Palin STSC(8–14)
• Unable to provide weekly family therapy sessions 
if allocated to Palin STSC(8–14) due to service or 
resource limitations.
Children:
• Have received therapy in the previous 6 months or 
are currently receiving speech and language ther -
apy
• Have attended the Michael Palin Centre for assess -
ment or therapy
• Do not have a parent who consents to take part in 
the study
• Are involved in any other research study which 
involves an intervention or multiple assessments
• Are accessing formal counselling through psycho -
logical services and the addition of Palin STSC is 
contra-indicated
Parents:
• Their child has been excluded for any reason
• There are any contra-indications for therapy. This 
might include any significant issues in the family 
which would be taken into account for the timing 
of any therapy, e.g. bereavement or birth of a baby.
Randomisation and allocation process
SLTs:  The randomisation list has been generated by 
Norwich Clinical Trials Unit data management team 
using an online sequence generation service, which is 
reviewed and approved by the study statistician. Speech 
and language therapists (SLTs) are randomly allocated 
into one of the two treatment arms: Palin STSC(8–14) 
or TAU, using blocked randomisation with a block 
length of 2, stratified by service.
Following consent and baseline data collection, a mem -
ber of the trial team responsible for trial enrolment ran -
domises the SLT via a web-based randomisation system 
integrated into the study database. An immediate alloca -
tion is provided by the system to the person entering the 
data. Automated email alerts are sent to the Site PI and 
the Research Assistant informing them of the allocation.
Child and parent dyads: Once baseline assessments 
are completed, families will be allocated to a SLT in 
Page 8 of 14 Millard et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:210 
accordance with local SLT service procedures. For some, 
the SLT is predetermined by clinic or school attended; 
for others, families are allocated on the basis of SLT 
availability (i.e. when a therapist has a free assessment 
appointment, the next family on the list are allocated to 
that appointment and therapist). Processes were moni -
tored by the research team to avoid the potential of bias 
in recruitment and allocation processes.
Procedure
SL T training
TAU:  SLTs in the TAU arm will receive training on the 
research process and procedures.
Palin STSC(8–14): SLTs in the Palin STSC(8–14) arm 
will also receive research protocol training, along with 
training in the Palin STSC(8–14) assessment and therapy 
methods. This has been developed into a package of 13 
video-recorded sessions which take approximately 20 h 
to complete (comparable to the original 3-day face to face 
training programme). In addition, SLTs will be able to 
attend up to three remote question and answer sessions 
with an SLT who is specialist in the programme.
Fidelity assessment
SLTs from both arms will complete an online ‘session 
summary checklist’ following each therapy session to 
detail the logistical information (location, attendees, ses -
sion number, length of time, etc.) and therapeutic ele -
ments/topics covered. Those from the Palin STSC(8–14) 
arm will be used to check the topics covered in each ses -
sion for fidelity purposes. In addition, SLTs delivering 
Palin STSC(8–14) will video record each therapy ses -
sion. A random sample of two sessions from each child 
will be evaluated by an SLT who is a specialist in the pro -
gramme, using a treatment fidelity checklist to be devel -
oped as part of the trial.
Measures
Basic demographic data on age, gender and ethnicity 
will be collected alongside stammering history infor -
mation (time since onset, family history, previous ther -
apy history). Selected quantitative measures have been 
chosen for their psychometric properties and clinical 
utility. Measures will be used to evaluate the feasibil -
ity outcomes: to ascertain recruitment and retention, 
treatment fidelity, treatment outcome, acceptability 
of the research and therapy methods. The study also 
includes measures for variables that are predicted to 
influence stammering impact and therapy outcome, 
since this will form part of the full-scale trial. Some 
of the assessments completed are directly relevant for the implementation of therapy and the results will be 
provided to the therapists for their clinical decision-
making needs (those provided to therapists in the Palin 
STSC(8–14) arm are marked *). Each therapist provid -
ing TAU will identify in advance any assessments that 
are part of usual practice and will receive the results of 
those. The online and postal questionnaires will take 
each parent and child approximately 1.5 h to complete.
Recruitment and retention rates
Recruitment and attrition rates will be established for 
SLTs, children and parents. The numbers of children 
approached, numbers consenting and attrition rates 
will be recorded. Participants are free to withdraw at 
any time without giving reasons and without prejudic -
ing any further treatment that would be usually avail -
able. Participants will be asked if they are willing to 
say why they are withdrawing so that this information 
may be used in the context of whether the therapy and 
trial methods are acceptable. Permission will be sought 
to use data to the point of withdrawal but this may be 
withdrawn up until the time of analysis.
Child‑completed measures
Speech sample* A video recording of the child read -
ing and talking during conversation, and analysed by the 
research assistant using the Stammering Severity Instru -
ment Fourth Edition [25] (SSI-4), provides a standardised 
clinical measure of stammering severity. The conversa -
tion section will be analysed using the CHILDES [26] 
system to examine the child’s use of language and turn 
taking skills. This will be conducted at both baseline and 
follow-up (4 min).
Satisfaction with fluency [27] Adapted from the Satis -
faction with Communication in Everyday Speaking Situ -
ations Scale [27] and completed on the on-line database. 
Children rate “how happy are you with your speech at the 
moment?” on a 9-point scale at both baseline and follow-
up (1 min).
Behavior Assessment Battery [28] The Behavior Assess -
ment Battery [28] includes Behavior Checklist, Speech 
Situation Checklists and Communication Attitude Test 
completed on paper. The Behavior Checklist requires a 
yes/no response to a series of potential features of stam -
mering. The child records whether or not each is typical 
of their own speech. Speech Situation Checklist consists 
of two parts. In the first, the child rates the severity of the 
stammering in different speaking situations (SSC-SD) on 
a series of likert scales, and the second, the child rates the 
degree of fear about speaking in different situations (SSC-
ER). Communication Attitude Test-Revised (CAT-R)*

 Millard et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:210 
 
evaluates the speech-related belief system of children 
who stammer using 35 items with Yes/No response. 
These assessments will be completed at both baseline and 
follow-up (30 min).
The Overall Assessment of the Speaker’s Experience of 
Stammering (School age/Teenage versions) (OASES‑S/T) 
[29]* The OASES-S [29] evaluates the impact of stam -
mering on an individual’s life across four sections: gen -
eral information, reactions to stammering, communica -
tion in daily situations and quality of life. For participants 
over the age of 12, the teenage version will be used. The 
OASES-S or OASES-T will be completed at both baseline 
and follow-up (15 min).
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) 
[30] This is a screening tool for behavioural, emotional 
and social development with 5 subscales: emotional 
symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/ inattention, 
peer relationship problems and pro-social behaviour. 
Children aged 11–14 years will complete an adolescent 
version at both baseline and follow-up (10 min).
Revised Children’s Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(RCADS) [31] This is a 47-item, youth self-report ques -
tionnaire with subscales including separation anxiety dis -
order (SAD), social phobia (SP), generalised anxiety dis -
order (GAD), panic disorder (PD), obsessive compulsive 
disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). 
There are parent and child versions for each to complete 
at both baseline and follow-up (10 min).
Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire‑Revised 
(EATQ‑R) [32] Designed to assess temperament in 
9–15 year olds to gain insight into positive and negative 
reactivity and regulation. There are two questionnaires, 
one for parents and one for young people. In the defini -
tive trial, temperament will be considered as a potential 
predictor variable for outcome. The EATQ-R [32] will be 
completed at baseline only.
Child Health Utility 9D (CHU‑9D) [34]  This is a series 
of 9 questions for the child to rate how they feel and their 
ability to participate in daily activities. The scores from this 
assessment can be converted to quality-adjusted life years 
and will be used in the health economic evaluation and it 
will be completed at both baseline and follow up (10 min).
Parent completed measures
Palin Parent Rating Scales (Palin PRS) [35]* This stand -
ardised assessment consists of 19 rating scales and is completed by parents to measure their perspective across 
three factors: the impact of the stammer on the child, 
the severity of the stammer and the impact on the par -
ents and parents’ knowledge about stammering and their 
confidence to support their child. It will be completed at 
both baseline and follow-up (5–10 min).
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) 
[30] Parent version of the SDQ described above will be 
completed at both baseline and follow-up (5–10 min).
Revised Children’s Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(RCADS) [31] Parent version of the RCADS described 
above will be completed at both baseline and follow-up 
(10 min).
Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire‑Revised 
(EATQ‑R) [32] Parent version of the EATQ-R described 
above. Parents of children aged 8 complete the Tempera -
ment in Middle Childhood Questionnaire (TMCQ) [33]. 
This will be completed at baseline only (40 min).
Quality of Life in a Child’s Chronic Disease Questionnaire 
(QLCCDQ) [36] This is a 15-item Likert scale concern -
ing the impact of a child’s impairment on a parent’s life. 
Parents will rate the degree to which their daily lives have 
been affected by the child’s condition in the previous 2 
weeks, at both baseline and follow-up (10 min).
Service Use Schedule This questionnaire has been 
developed for the purposes of this study and explores the 
use of different services for the health economic evalua -
tion. It will be completed at both baseline and follow-up 
(10 min).
Completed by speech and language therapists
Confidence and knowledge about working with children 
who stammer A questionnaire has been developed for 
the purposes of this study to explore therapists’ knowl -
edge and practices for working with school age chil -
dren who stammer in the NHS. The SLTs confidence in 
working with this client group will also be explored. It is 
anticipated that these factors will improve with the trial 
for therapists in both treatment arms and so this will be 
completed at baseline and at the end of the trial. Those in 
the Palin STSC(8–14) treatment arm will also complete 
this at the end of their training in the programme (15 
min).
Session record form SLTs will record the content of each 
therapy session using a checklist, along with attendance 
Page 10 of 14 Millard et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:210 
and the homework completed by the family. This will 
inform the degree to which SLTs are completing the pro -
gramme and the engagement of the families, providing 
data for the treatment fidelity evaluation and acceptabil -
ity of the therapy methods (10 min per therapy session).
Data collection
Each parent and child dyad will complete the question -
naires at baseline and again approximately 6 months later. 
Study data will be collected and managed using REDCap 
electronic data capture tools hosted at the University of 
East Anglia [37]. REDCap (Research Electronic Data 
Capture) is a secure, web-based application designed to 
support data capture for research studies, providing (1) 
an intuitive interface for validated data entry, (2) audit 
trails for tracking data manipulation and export proce -
dures, (3) automated export procedures for seamless data 
downloads to common statistical packages and (4) proce -
dures for importing data from external sources.
Prior to COVID, all measures were completed online 
into a REDCAP database platform developed and man -
aged by NCTU with the exception of the Speech Situ -
ation Checklists, Communication Attitude Test [28], 
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [30] and Stut -
tering Severity Instrument-4 [25] which were completed 
in person with the Research Assistant. Following COVID, 
the Speech Situation Checklists, Communication Atti -
tude Test [28] and Strengths and Difficulties Question -
naire [30] were changed to postal completion and the 
Stuttering Severity Instrument-4 [25] was collected via 
video link with the Research Assistant.
All SLT measures were completed online.
Process evaluation
As recommended by the Medical Research Council guid -
ance for RCTs [38], we will include a qualitative process 
evaluation of the trial and the intervention. We hope 
to identify the barriers and facilitators to taking part in 
the trial, as well as modifications that can be made to 
improve the experience of taking part in this research.
A purposive sample of 4 SLTs, 4 children and 4 parents 
from each treatment arm will be recruited to take part 
in semi-structured qualitative interviews at the start and 
end of therapy, and at the end of the trial. We will seek to 
recruit children of different ages, from different services, 
with varying levels of stammering impact, and parents 
with differing levels of knowledge and confidence. We 
will select therapists from different speech and language 
therapy services and from both Palin STSC(8–14) and 
Treatment as Usual groups. These participants will com -
plete semi-structured interviews at the three time points 
(total: 72 interviews).We noticed that when we first spoke to SLTs and SLT 
teams that they were very enthusiastic and would sug -
gest that multiple SLTs would be available to take part. 
However, it was often the case that by the time the R&D 
approvals were in place and recruitment of SLTs started, 
the numbers reduced considerably compared to the 
numbers originally proposed. Further, during conversa -
tions with SLTs during their baseline interviews and in 
their training sessions, it became apparent that the sup -
port and attitudes of different managers varied but cru -
cial for successful participation. We therefore amended 
the protocol to include interviews with managers to iden -
tify the drivers that influenced decisions about whether 
a service or individual therapist could take part in the 
trial and the amount of time they would be given to do 
so. Understanding the facilitators and obstacles from 
managers’ perspectives will inform how managers are 
approached and the information that they receive in the 
full-scale trial.
We will interview a small sample of 4–6 service man -
agers of participating sites at two time points: the open -
ing of their service as a research site and at the end of 
the trial. We will aim to understand more about why the 
service managers agreed for their service and staff mem -
bers to take part in the trial, their expectations of service 
participation and their experience of having their service 
involved. All interviews will be conducted over the phone 
and audio recorded.
Once the Palin STSC(8–14) training package is com -
pleted, SLTs will provide feedback about the quality and 
content of the training, with recommendations for any 
changes. This is particularly important given the changes 
made to the method of training that were made as a 
result of the pandemic (15 min).
Analysis plan
The primary statistical analysis will be directed towards 
the aims of the feasibility study outlined under the aims 
and objectives section. Particularly, the values under 
objective 1, including recruitment and attrition rates, 
will be calculated with an appropriate 95% confidence 
interval to inform the design of a future study. Similarly, 
we will aim to quantify and summarise treatment ‘doses’ 
actually delivered and adherence.
Although not designed as an efficacy trial, we will 
make an initial estimate of treatment effect on the above-
named efficacy variables using linear models with appro -
priate link and error terms. These will adjust for known 
baseline prognostic variables (decided prior to analysis) 
and will be presented with 95% confidence intervals. 
Data from all participants as randomised in the trial will 
be included in the ‘intention to treat’ analyses. To avoid 
Page 11 of 14
 Millard et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:210 
 
attrition bias, outcome data from all participants will be 
included regardless of protocol adherence.
For the process evaluation, all interviews will be tran -
scribed and analysed using constant comparisons from 
grounded theory methodology to explore themes regard -
ing process variables, fidelity and acceptability for both 
the therapy and the trial methods.
In terms of health economics, estimation of cost-
effectiveness, within a health-technology assessment, is 
an iterative process [39]. Here we aim to monitor levels 
of resource-use and quality of life (QoL), to inform the 
decision as to how costs and benefits can be measured as 
part of a future, more definitive study. We will therefore 
estimate the completion rates for both the aforemtioned 
CHU-9D (responses to the CHU-9D can be converted 
into QALY (quality-adjusted life year) scores) [40] and 
service use schedule, and seek to identify big cost drivers.
Discussion
The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of a 
definitive randomised controlled trial comparing Palin 
Stammering Therapy for School Children (8–14) with 
treatment as usual. The programme was developed to 
meet the needs of school aged children who stammer and 
their parents and to provide speech and language thera -
pists with an evidence based programme that they can 
implement with confidence following training. While the 
principles of the intervention appear to be theoretically 
sound and the clinical outcomes obtained at the centre 
where it was developed are promising, there are many 
questions about the transferability and effectiveness of 
the programme into non-specialist NHS contexts.
The first aim of the feasibility study is to establish 
whether sufficient numbers of SLTs, children and par -
ents can be recruited to a full trial. We need to estab -
lish attrition rates at each stage in order to establish the 
sample size required for statistical power in the full trial. 
We wish to identify the factors that affect recruitment 
and attrition to adjust the procedures accordingly for the 
definitive trial, where possible.
The second issue relates to the quantitative battery of 
measures included. The measures have been selected 
for their potential to provide estimates of the effective -
ness and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and 
the factors that predict outcome. The overt character -
istics of stammering would be expected to reduce with 
this therapy, either in terms of frequency or severity 
(amount of struggle and duration, along with frequency) 
and is measured through the speech sample analysis. 
However, there are important limitations to stuttering 
frequency and severity measures as they do not neces -
sarily reflect the degree to which stammering is occur -
ring. People who stammer frequently avoid and change words or use strategies to mask the stammering. Also, 
what might be considered by a listener to be ‘mild’ may 
be experienced differently by the speaker. Furthermore, 
as children reduce avoidance behaviours, overt stam -
mering would be expected to increase and would be 
considered a positive outcome. Therefore, it is important 
to seek the speaker’s view of their stammering behaviour 
alongside objective observational methods. In addition, 
stammering can affect a person’s ability to communi -
cate and participate in daily situations and can have an 
impact on emotional well-being. Stammering also has 
an impact on parents. Reducing the impact of stammer -
ing is an important outcome for therapy. However, the 
impact that stammering has on either a child or parent 
is not necessarily related to the frequency or severity of 
the stammering and so this has to be measured sepa -
rately and so there are a number of measures included 
in this trial for that purpose (OASES-S [29], BAB [28], 
Palin PRS [35]). Finally, the impact of stammering and 
the outcome of therapy are influenced by a number of 
variables, which may or may not include stammering 
severity and so other, more distal variables likely to be 
associated with therapy outcome (e.g. temperament 
[41]) will also be completed. In this feasibility trial, we 
aim to find out if this battery of assessments is sensitive 
and extensive enough for the outcome evaluation, but we 
are also aware of the potential burden of such an exten -
sive battery. It will be important to establish whether the 
assessment battery is too large, creating a burden that 
contributes to recruitment and retention rates.
The remaining issues relate to the acceptability of the 
therapy approach and the trial methods, including fidel -
ity and adherence to the programme. To date this pro -
gramme has only been implemented at the Michael Palin 
Centre where it was developed, by therapists who are 
highly specialist in the field and who have been involved 
in the development of the programme. It is not known 
whether therapists with less background knowledge and 
experience in stammering can be taught these methods 
and gain a strong grasp of the underlying principles of 
the intervention through a relatively short training pro -
gramme. It is not known what therapy or how much ther -
apy is currently available to this client group and whether 
therapists will be able to integrate this programme into 
their working practices. It is also possible that outcomes 
may be affected by any differences between local popu -
lations and the population who attend the Michael Palin 
Centre, such as levels of complexity or motivation. Any 
of these unknown variables will influence the implemen -
tation of the definitive trial and therapy outcomes in the 
NHS in the long term.
Since opening in June 2019, there have been some sub -
stantial amendments to the trial methods. The trial was 
Page 12 of 14 Millard et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:210 
suspended in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 
pandemic. It re-opened in January 2021 following a con -
sultative scoping exercise with recruited sites. Speech 
and language services were severely affected by the pan -
demic, many therapists were redeployed, some services 
were closed entirely and others offered only emergency 
support. Those sites that had opened prior to the pan -
demic were largely located in and around London and 
were particularly badly affected. Despite intentions to 
reopen, the ongoing and unpredictable nature of the 
pandemic meant that recruitment of sites and thera -
pists had to start again, almost from the beginning, 
when the trial reopened. Prior to the trial re-opening, 
all procedures were amended so that they could take 
place remotely. This was to eliminate any additional face-
to-face contact incurred through the trial and to try to 
ensure that the trial could proceed if further lockdowns 
occur. The changes mean that consent is completed via 
the online database, research assistant-led assessments 
are conducted by a video call or sent by post, SLT train -
ing has been converted into a series of video recordings 
that can be completed over time and there is an option 
to deliver therapy via an online video platform. These 
changes resulted in a number of unexpected advantages 
with procedures which are considerably more resource 
efficient for SLTs, families and the research team, 
increasing accessibility to both therapy and the research 
trial, and enabling recruitment to extend beyond the 
South-East of England.
If there is evidence from this feasibility trial that SLTs, 
parents and children are willing and able  to participate; 
if the barriers to recruitment and retention can be iden -
tified and addressed; the outcome measures are deemed 
appropriate and sensitive to change; and, the therapy and 
research methods are acceptable to participants, then 
this protocol will be adapted and developed into a full 
scale definitive trial.  Ultimately, should the study pro -
gress to a definitive trial and demonstrate effectiveness, 
the benefits to children who stammer and their parents 
could be substantial. Having an evidence-based interven -
tion that can be implemented in local services has high 
potential to influence SLT training, inform service deliv -
ery models, increase SLT confidence in working with this 
client group, improve outcomes and reduce the long-
term impact that stammering can have on children and 
their parents.
Trial status
Ethical approval was obtained on 17 June 2019 from 
London-Bloomsbury REC. Following suspension of 
the trial through the pandemic, a funded extension 
was received. Recruitment of SLTs was closed early as 
the target numbers were reached and recruitment of children and parents will be completed by December 
2021 to allow for follow-up data collection by 6 June 
2022. Intervention is currently underway. Data analysis 
and interpretation of the results will take place before 
the end of the trial on 31 August 2022.
Adverse events
As this is a low-risk trial, a clinical review of a line listing 
of all SAEs, AEs, ARs and trends in events and reactions 
will take place on a monthly basis by the Research Team 
(i.e. those involved in the day to day running of the trial). 
Any adverse events or reactions which are considered 
serious by the PI or SLT involved will be reported to the 
CI within 24 h.
A cumulative review of all safety information will be 
conducted on a 6 monthly basis by the Research Manage -
ment Group and the Trial Steering Committee.
Monitoring
There is an Advisory Group made up of the research 
management group and members who represent parents 
of children who stammer; charity groups who advocate 
for people who stammer (Action for Stammering Chil -
dren; Stamma); generalist and specialist SLTs; and young 
people who stammer who have sought SLT through the 
NHS in the past. There is a Trial Steering Committee 
(TSC) made up of independent experts who oversee the 
implementation and progress of the trial. The decision 
to stop the trial prematurely will be made by the Trial 
Steering Committee and the Sponsor if fewer than 25% of 
participants have been recruited 1 year into the trial, or if 
there is substantial evidence that participants in the Palin 
STSC(8–14) group are withdrawing as a consequence of 
the therapy itself.
Both the TSC and the Advisory group meet on a 6 
monthly basis or more frequently as required. Site pro -
cedures will be monitored on a monthly basis by the CI, 
the RA and the local PI. Procedures will be monitored 
3 monthly by the research management group and six 
monthly by the TSC. Trial processes undertaken by the 
RA will be reviewed once a month by the CI and RMG 
during the data collection phases of the study, and six 
monthly by the TSC.
Dissemination
We aim to publish the methodological lessons and quan -
titative and qualitative findings in peer-reviewed sci -
entific journals. Preliminary results will be presented at 
the International Fluency Conference May 2022. Partici -
pants (SLTs and parents) will be notified of the outcome 
of the trial, via a specifically designed summary report.
