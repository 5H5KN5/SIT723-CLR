Abstract
Background: Problem gambling and gambling disorder are major public health concerns worldwide, and
awareness of associated negative consequences is rising. In parallel, treatment demand has increased, and Internet
interventions offer a promising alternative for providing evidence-based treatment at scale to a low cost.
Method: We developed a novel Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral treatment for gambling, based on
qualitative interviews with treatment-seeking gamblers, behavioral research on gambling behavior, and the
pathway model for problem gambling. This research protocol describes a non-randomized pilot and feasibility trial
conducted in routine addiction care with adult treatment-seeking patients (max N= 25) with problem gambling.
The primary aim is to ensure acceptability and safety, measured by satisfaction, credibility, working alliance, and
possible negative effects. Secondary aims are feasibility of study procedures in terms of recruitment and
measurement procedures as well as potential effectiveness measured weekly by gambling symptoms as primary
outcome and gambling behavior, quality of life, symptoms of depression and anxiety, alcohol, and drug use as
secondary outcomes. Potential mediators measured weekly are loss of control, verbal rules, and well-being.
Discussion: This study is innovative in several respects, regarding both treatment development and
implementation. The results of the study will guide a future randomized controlled trial, as well as the development
of the intervention and intervention implementation within ordinary addiction care.

Background
Gambling, an activity where something of value is risked
and the probability of winning or losing is less than cer-
tain [ 1], can lead to significant and social harm, here
termed problem gambling. Problem gambling is defined
as“excessive gambling behaviour that creates negative
consequences for the gambler, others in his/her social
network, and for the community ”[2].
Problem gambling can also be expressed in terms of a
clinical diagnosis. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Man-
ual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) [ 3], the
clinical diagnostic criteria for pathological gambling
were revised and labeled gambling disorder, adding gam-
bling to addiction disorders instead of the previous diag-
nostic categorization as an impulse control disorder.
Gambling disorder was thereby the first addictive behav-
ior not involving a psychoactive substance to be recog-
nized as an addiction diagnosis. Henceforth, the term
problem gambling will be used here, sometimes referring
to problem gamblers who also fulfil the diagnostic cri-
teria for gambling disorder. The transferral of the gam-
bling disorder diagnosis to addictions was associated
with a political process in Sweden, whereby problem
gambling received more highly profiled attention from
government authorities such as the Public Health
Agency and the National Board of Health and Welfare,
yielding prevention research summaries and treatment
recommendations presented at local and national con-
ferences [ 4]. In parallel, two significant pieces of legisla-
tion were enacted in Sweden following a long period of
preparation; one concerned obligatory provision of treat-
ment on par with other addictive disorders, and the sec-
ond re-regulated the gambling market, including
prescription of duty of care actions on the part of the
gambling industry.
Problem gambling is associated with severe negative
consequences for financial and mental health, including
high rates of suicidal ideation and attempts [ 5,6]. The
past year prevalence of problem gambling in the general
population varies globally between 0.3% and 5.3% [ 7]. In
Sweden, the estimated population prevalence of current
problem gambling is 2.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]
1.8, 2.4) [ 8]. A meta-analysis focusing on the prevalence
of problem gambling in clinical samples of treatment-
seeking substance users found that approximately 23%
suffered from conditions along the spectrum of problem
gambling [ 9]. Preliminary studies have suggested that
the prevalence of problem gambling among patients and
clients within the Swedish primary health care system
and social services is 6% and 19%, respectively [ 10,11].
Meta-analyses have concluded that psychological treat-
ments, mainly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), are
effective for reducing gambling behavior and related
problems [ 12,13]. For example, Pallesen et al. concludedin one meta-analysis [ 13] that a range of different self-
report measures had been used as outcomes in the in-
cluded studies, but that the overall between-group effect
size, represented as the difference between the mean
score in a treatment condition and a no-treatment con-
trol condition, was 1.59 ( p< .01) at treatment follow
(averaging 17 months). Furthermore, CBT has also
shown promising results in Internet-delivered formats
(iCBT [ 14,15];), although a recent scoping review con-
cluded that the current literature is sparse and more re-
search is needed [ 16].
Despite relatively high prevalence and associated nega-
tive consequences, problem gambling often goes un-
treated within routine health care. Only 10% of those
afflicted seek face-to-face help for gambling problems
[17]. A review of barriers for seeking help for gambling
problems found that common reported reasons for not
seeking treatment included a wish to handle problem by
oneself, shame/embarrassment/stigma, unwillingness to
admit the problem, concerns about treatment content
and quality, lack of knowledge about treatment availabil-
ity, or practical issues around attending treatment [ 18].
From a treatment-oriented perspective, the research field
of problem gambling has been described as 20 –30 years
behind that of other substance use disorders [ 19,20].
Another treatment-related challenge for problem gam-
bling is psychiatric comorbidity. Håkansson et al. [ 21]
found that 58% of Swedish treatment-seeking gamblers
also suffered from comorbid conditions. Most common
were anxiety, stress-related and somatoform disorders
(29%), mood disorders (22%), and alcohol and drug use
disorders (12%); this result is congruent with inter-
national research on comorbidity among treatment-
seeking gamblers [ 22,23]. In an effort to explain the
high prevalence of comorbidity among gamblers, Blas-
zczynski and Nower [ 2] proposed a theoretical etio-
logical pathway model with three different types of
problem gamblers: behaviorally conditioned gamblers
who gamble due to excitement/arousal, irrational beliefs,
habituation, and chasing of losses; emotional vulnerable
gamblers who gamble due to mood disturbances, life
stresses, poor coping/problem-solving, and substance
use; and antisocial/impulsive gamblers who gamble due
to neuropsychological impulsive traits, substance use
disorders, and antisocial behavior.
Although iCBT has been recommended as a suitable
option, particularly for reducing barriers to accessing
professional help [ 16], few attempts have been made to
implement iCBT for problem gambling within existing
addiction treatment services. We have developed a novel
Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral treatment for
gambling based on qualitative interviews with treatment-
seeking gamblers (unpublished data), basic research on
the learning and maintenance processes of gamblingMolander et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:106 Page 2 of 11
behavior [ 24], as well as the pathway model [ 2]. This
protocol describes the first iCBT pilot and feasibility trial
within a research program aiming to evaluate and imple-
ment treatment models for problem gambling within
routine care.
Objectives
The primary aim of this non-randomized pilot and feasi-
bility trial is to ensure that a novel iCBT treatment is ac-
ceptable and safe for patients in routine care.
Specifically, we aim to evaluate acceptability and safety
in terms of the following:
/C15Treatment satisfaction
/C15Possible negative effects due to psychological
treatment
/C15Treatment credibility
/C15Working alliance
Secondly, we aim to evaluate feasibility of the follow-
ing study procedures for a future randomized controlled
trial:
/C15Recruitment procedures and recruitment rates
/C15Measurement procedures within the newly
developed Stöd och Behandling (support and
treatment) (SaT) platform
Thirdly, we aim to evaluate potential effectiveness and
possible mediators of treatment:
/C15Gambling symptoms as the primary outcome
/C15Gambling behavior, quality of life, symptoms of
depression and anxiety, alcohol, and drug use as
secondary outcomes
/C15Use of stimulus control strategies, loss of control in
gambling situations, problematic gambling-related
thinking, and well-being, all as possible mediators of
treatment effects
Methods
Study design
The study is a non-randomized pilot and feasibility trial
of iCBT with treatment-seeking participants (max N=
25) conducted in routine care. Participants will be
assessed for diagnostic criteria of gambling disorder and
psychiatric comorbidity prior to treatment and complete
self-reported outcome measures pre-treatment (clinical
assessment), weekly during treatment, post-treatment,
and at a 3-month follow-up. Participants will be allowed
16 weeks to complete the treatment program.
The study was pre-registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT
ID: NCT03946098). The TREND statement guidelinesfor non-randomized interventions [ 25] will be followed
when reporting the trial.
Recruitment procedure
Participants, all treatment-seeking patients, will be re-
cruited via two paths: one indirect and the other direct.
The indirect path involves recruiting patients from one
of eight outpatient clinics belonging to the publicly oper-
ated Stockholm Center for Dependency Disorders. These
clinics offer face-to-face treatment to patients with sub-
stance use disorders such as alcohol and drugs as well as
problem gambling. Support is also offered to the pa-
tients ’concerned significant others. Patients seeking
treatment for problem gambling undergo a routine as-
sessment visit with a physician, nurse, or psychologist,
on which occasion they will be informed that available
treatments include face-to-face treatment or iCBT. Writ-
ten information will be supplied in the form of a pamph-
let, and the clinician will be able to answer any
questions that arise. The recruiting clinician will make a
preliminary assessment of eligibility, administrating the
Problem Gambling Severity Index [ 26] included in the
pamphlet; the purpose of this screening is to ensure that
gambling symptoms have been present the last year, and
these results will not be reported in the study. Patients
deemed eligible and indicating interest in iCBT will be
referred via formal clinical referral to the Addiction eCli-
nic, which will make the final decision as to whether
iCBT is suitable. The direct recruitment path involves
recruiting participants among treatment-seeking patients
accessing online self-referral to iCBT at the Addiction
eClinic. A physician will screen all self-referrals and
schedule suitable patients for a video conference session,
for clinical assessment, after which the eClinic will make
a final decision as to whether iCBT is suitable. See Fig. 1
for recruitment paths and participant flow.
Eligibility criteria
This is a pilot and feasibility trial conducted in routine
care. Although we expect that most participants will fulfill
the diagnostic criteria for gambling disorder, as well as cri-
teria for other common psychiatric comorbidities, clinical
eligibility criteria will apply, where all treatment-seeking
gamblers presenting problem gambling symptoms during
the past year, and deemed eligible, will be offered iCBT.
The inclusion criteria are (a) having a total score of > = 1
on the Problem Gambling Severity Index [ 26], (b) being at
least 18 years old, (c) living in Sweden, (d) having the abil-
ity to work with online treatment material by themselves,
and (e) being able to read and write Swedish.
Participants will be excl uded from the study if they
(a) fulfill criteria for ongoing manic episode or (b)
are undergoing a parallel CBT treatment for problem
gambling.Molander et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:106 Page 3 of 11
Platform
Treatment will be delivered using the recently intro-
duced and nationally available Stöd och Behandling (sup-
port and treatment, SaT) platform for Internet-delivered
treatments within routine care, both psychiatric and
somatic. Usage is not anonymous and requires login
using a secure, bank-issued national e-identification so-
lution. The same platform, with different interfaces, is
used by patients and health care professionals. Regu-
lar licensed clinical psychologists at the eClinic will
serve as therapists, involving monitoring, encouraging
and praising compliance and progress, unlocking
modules, and answering questions. This is typically
done through asynchronous messages within the SaT
platform, complemented as needed by telephone calls.
Established clinical procedure will be followed, includ-
ing telephone calls at specific timepoints in case of
poor compliance (no logins or progress) or indica-
tions of suicidality.Measures
Self-rated measures will be collected using the SaT plat-
form from inclusion to treatment termination and using
a separate online research platform for the follow-up
(due to clinical policy not permitting access to the SaT
platform after concluded treatment). All self-report mea-
sures apart from initial screening will be completed by
the participants online on their own. See Table 1for full
list of measures and the measurement points.
Diagnostic assessment
Prior to treatment, participants will be screened with the
Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI [ 26];) and of-
fered to complete other measures targeting gambling be-
havior, as part of a separate, parallel Swedish
psychometric study [ 27]. Criteria for Gambling Disorder
and comorbidity will be assessed with clinical interviews:
the Structured Clinical Interview for Gambling Disorder
[28] and the Mini International NeuropsychiatricFig. 1 Recruitment paths and participant flowMolander et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:106 Page 4 of 11
Interview, version 7 [ 29], respectively. Gambling type ac-
cording to the pathway model [ 2] will be measured with
the Gambling Pathways Questionnaire [ 30].
Acceptability and safety measures
Satisfaction with treatment and potential negative effects
due to treatment will be measured with the Client Satis-
faction Questionnaire —8-item version [ 31] and the
Negative Effects Questionnaire —20-item version [ 32],
respectively, both administered at post-treatment. Per-
ceived credibility and expectancy will be measured with
the Credibility/Expectancy questionnaire [ 33], adminis-
tered at the end of the second introductory treatment
module. Working alliance will be measured with the
Working Alliance Inventory-Revised Short Version [ 34],
at the end of the third treatment module.
Feasibility of study procedures
The recruitment rate will be defined as the number of
participants recruited per month. This will serve as a
basis for evaluating —and possibly adapting —the recruit-
ment procedures described above, to ensure power in a
planned future randomized controlled trial. Measure-
ment procedures within the SaT platform will also bepiloted during the trial, for example to ensure reliable
measurement points and data extraction.
Primary outcome measure of potential effectiveness
The primary outcome, gambling symptoms, will be mea-
sured with the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale
which is a valid and reliable measure for assessing clin-
ical change during treatment studies. The Gambling
Symptom Assessment Scale have been evaluated in a
population of treatment-seeking gamblers, compared to
other gambling measures and clinical ratings adminis-
tered weekly during a 12-week study period, showing ex-
cellent convergent validity, excellent internal consistency
(α= 0.87), and test-retest reliability 0.56 [ 35]. In this
study, the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale will be
administered at pre-treatment, weekly during treatment,
post-treatment, and at the 3-month follow-up.
Secondary outcome measures
Secondary outcomes will encompass gambling behavior,
mental health, substance use, and quality of life. Gam-
bling behavior (gambling type, frequency, time spent,
money wagered, sums won-lost) will be measured by the
Gambling TimeLine Follow Back, a reliable and validTable 1 Measures and measurement points

method for assessing gambling behavior among gam-
blers and problem gamblers [ 36,37]. Mental health (de-
pression and anxiety) will be measured by the 9-item
Patient Health Questionnaire [ 38] and the 7-item Gener-
alized Anxiety Disorder scale [ 39]. Alcohol use will be
measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification
Test [ 40], and drug use will be measured by the Drug
Use Disorders Identification Test [ 41]. Quality of life will
be measured by the 26-item World Health Organization
Quality of Life-BREF questionnaire [ 42].
Process measures (possible mediators)
This study will explore four possible mediators of treat-
ment effects to be explored further in a planned future
randomized controlled trial. Stimulus control strategies
to limit access to gambling opportunities (for example,
self-exclusion) will be measured by an item constructed
for the purpose of this study. Loss of control in gambling
situations will be measured by a revised version of item
15 from the Scale of Gambling Choices [ 43], and prob-
lematic gambling-related thinking (for example, “If I lose
money gambling, I should try to win it back ”) will be
measured by revised versions of items 6, 7, 8, and 13
from the Gambler ’s Beliefs Questionnaire [ 44].In order
to facilitate ease of response and consistency, all items
will be rated using a 0 –100 visual analog scale, regard-
less of original response format. Participants will also
rate general well-being using the same scale.
Treatment
Treatment will consist of a 1 + 10 module iCBT pro-
gram targeting problem gambling, newly developed by
the authors (see TIDIER supplementary material ). The
pre-program module will contain an introduction to on-
line treatment as well as collection of pre-treatment
measures within the SaT platform. After that, partici-
pants will complete the 10 treatment modules at a pace
of once a week, completing homework assignments fa-
cilitating behavior change during each week. The au-
thors ’experience of iCBT delivery for addictive
disorders in a clinical setting is that participants work at
a slower pace than one module per week and are likely
to need longer to complete the treatment. Hence, partic-
ipants will be allowed 16 weeks to complete the program
(with exceptions possible if deemed clinically appropri-
ate), and measures will be collected alongside each mod-
ule, which is unlocked at a maximum pace of once per
week. During treatment, participants will have online
contact via asynchronous secure messages with an
assigned clinical psychologist at the Addiction eClinic.
A bottom-up procedure was used to develop the treat-
ment protocol, inspired by Clark ’s method for developing
novel CBT treatments [ 45]. A comprehensive description
of the development process is outside the scope of thisarticle and will be described elsewhere. Briefly, we devel-
oped a clinical model delineating factors that contribute
to the persistence of problem gambling behavior. We then
aligned these with treatment interventions targeting each
specific factor, based on qualitative interviews with
treatment-seeking gamblers with or without psychiatric
comorbidity (unpublished data), basic experimental re-
search on the learning, and maintenance processes of
gambling behavior [ 24], as well as the pathway model [ 2].

study, all patients and potential participants are assessed
for suitability for online treatment (including assessment
of suicide risk), patient activity (including measures) is
monitored weekly, and there is a procedure for handling
absence of activity, including secure messages, telephone
calls, and/or letters, at different timepoints. Patients will
have the option of continuing contact with their recruit-
ing clinic for any additional treatment needs.
Ethical considerations
All participants will provide digital informed consent in
the first pre-program module of the online program.
Since the study is carried out within a clinical context
with treatment-seeking patients, those patients who do
not wish to provide consent for research participation
will nonetheless receive exactly the same treatment, but
not included in study-related data collection and ana-
lysis. This study is approved by the Regional Ethics
Board of Stockholm, Sweden (ref. no. 2017/1479-31),
pending a minor amendment.Planned statistical analyses
Acceptability measures
Descriptive statistics on treatment credibility, treatment
satisfaction, and working alliance will be presented in
means and standard deviations. Occurrence of possible
negative effects due to psychological treatment will be
presented descriptively and in frequencies, means, and
standard deviations.
Potential effectiveness
Scores from the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale
and TLFB-derived measures, collected weekly, will be
modeled using appropriate mixed effects models [ 46] de-
pending on distribution (e.g., Gaussian, lognormal, Pois-
son, zero-inflated versions), with maximum likelihood
estimation of missing data and appropriate numeric
time-variable(s) [ 47]. Outcome measures collected less
frequently will be modeled using Generalized Estimating
Equations. The results will be used to calculate power
and sample size in a planned future randomized
Fig. 2 Example of treatment content. Cases illustrating treatment proceduresMolander et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:106 Page 7 of 11
controlled trial. In the current study, we aim to recruit n
= 25 participants to assess feasibility; assuming that sam-
ple baseline means and standard deviations on the Gam-
bling Symptom Assessment Scale are similar to an
ongoing treatment study at the same treatment center
(M= 24.9, SD = 11), the pilot study should be able to
detect a within-group effect size of at least d> 0.6 under
realistic circumstances. See Fig. 3for a power spectrum
plot, showing what corresponding effect size (as a func-
tion of a range of post-treatment means and standard
deviations) can be detected with 80% power, with differ-
ent assumed within-subject correlations.
We will explore possible mediators of treatment effects
by examining correlations between change in symptoms
and change in the process measures, and we will also ex-
plore time-lagged effects. Descriptive statistics on ac-
ceptability measures and platform activity (completed
modules, number of logins, etc.) will also be presented.
Discussion
This non-randomized trial aims to evaluate the accept-
ability, feasibility, potential effectiveness, and possible
negative effects of a novel iCBT protocol in a sample of
treatment-seeking participants with problem gambling
within routine care. The study is innovative in several
respects.
Firstly, the study will be conducted in routine care for
problem gambling with a sample of treatment-seeking
patients, most of whom are expected to meet criteria for
gambling disorder. The external validity of the study will
thus be very high. All treatment-seeking patients,including those with comorbidities, will be offered iCBT.
This is uncommon, as patients with comorbidities are
often excluded from treatment studies as well as from
gambling treatment within routine care. A further ad-
vantage with iCBT is that it can reduce the waiting time
to initiate treatment. The waiting time for group treat-
ment for problem gambling at the Stockholm Center for
Dependency Disorders can vary greatly between clinics
and seasons: patients may have to wait between 1 and 12
months, depending on demand; such a long wait is often
too long when considering treatment-relevant factors
such as motivational windows that often co-occur with
treatment-seeking [ 48].
Second, we have used a bottom-up approach in the
treatment development process. This includes deriving
the treatment content from in-depth clinical interviews
with treatment-seeking gamblers, research on the learn-
ing, and maintenance processes of gambling behavior, as
well as the pathway model for PG [ 2]. Also, we designed
the treatment protocol to build on a simple, delimited
set of interventions of presumed greatest importance.
This is contrary to typical addiction treatments that offer
a smorgasbord of exercises and treatment rationales in
an attempt to capture all relevant aspects that may apply
differently to different patients. As a research field, the
study of treatment for problem gambling is still in its in-
fancy. Current CBT protocols for problem gambling are
seldom based on a functional analysis on why problem
gambling behavior persists over time despite negative
consequences. This is so, despite the fact that problem
gambling is a phenomenon that has generated basic
Fig. 3 Power curves as a function of post-treatment means, SDs, and within-r, with line weights according to resulting effect sizeMolander et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:106 Page 8 of 11
research on the learning processes involved. In general,
a broad mixture of general CBT components, which
have been found effective for other conditions such as
depression, anxiety, or alcohol problems, have often
been arbitrarily combined into treatment protocols [ 49],
while interventions targeting key gambling processes
such as “chasing losses, ”or“loss of control ”[2,50] have
been lacking. In contrast, utilizing a few, carefully se-
lected treatment components, will hopefully enable a
more clear definition of what to prioritize in treatment,
opportunities for continuous applied behavior change, as
well as better controlled studies in terms of mediating
and moderating factors.
Third, this study aims to evaluate novel treatment con-
tent in an iCBT format without prior face-to-face evalu-
ation. This is uncommon, but in view of the large body
of evidence indicating that iCBT yields outcomes com-
parable to face-to-face treatment [ 51], the increasing ac-
ceptance of iCBT as a treatment form, and the
availability of an eClinic within the Stockholm Center
for Dependency Disorders as the trial setting, we have
opted to eliminate the step of face-to-face evaluation, in-
stead using telephone and video meetings, prior to the
iCBT launch in this pilot and feasibility trial. Addition-
ally, we see the use of the nationally available SaT digital
platform, as enabling rapid development, deployment
and dissemination, evaluation, and optimization of novel
treatment interventions into routine care.
The study will also be subject to some limitations. A
non-randomized pilot and feasibility trial will not yield
knowledge on whether observed effects are causal, nor
enable evaluation of effects for specific subgroups of
gamblers through randomization to typical or subgroup-
tailored treatment. By design, this single-arm study will
only provide an uncontrolled estimate of the treatment
effect and not of the spontaneous remission or
treatment-as-usual, to which the treatment effect will be
compared in future randomized trials. However, non-
randomized pilot trial designs are common as a first step
in the development and evaluation of novel interven-
tions. Apart from evaluating acceptability, feasibility,
possible effectiveness, and potential negative effects, the
pilot outcomes of this study will hopefully provide some
clues as to whether further treatment adaptations for
problem gambling and comorbidity specifically, might be
necessary, a research question which can then be ex-
plored in a future randomized controlled trial.
