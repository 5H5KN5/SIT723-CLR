Abstract 
Background: To our knowledge, there is no intervention which includes personalised exercise therapy and self-man-
agement support for people with multimorbidity, although these interventions may be as effective as for people with 
single chronic conditions. Therefore, we developed a novel intervention, including personalised exercise therapy and 
self-management support for people with multimorbidity.
Methods: We followed the Medical Research Council framework and conducted one scoping review, five systematic 
reviews, two registry-based studies, one qualitative interview study and a mixed-methods feasibility study. Following 
an iterative approach, together with feedback from people with multimorbidity and relevant stakeholders, we devel-
oped the MOBILIZE intervention.
Results: The intervention included 24 (60 minutes) sessions of personalised exercise therapy and 24 (30 minutes) 
sessions of self-management support twice a week for 12 weeks, delivered in small groups by specifically trained 
physiotherapists. The intervention targets physiological, psychosocial, behavioural, and contextual factors to improve 
health-related quality of life and physical function in people living with multimorbidity.
Conclusions: We developed a personalised exercise therapy and self-management support programme for people 
with multimorbidity. The intervention will be tested for its safety and effectiveness in a randomised controlled trial.

Key findings
• We developed a novel intervention for people with 
multimorbidity through an iterative and comprehen -
sive process following the Medical Research Council 
framework. This included several reviews, cohort 
studies and interviews with people with multimor -
bidity and several stakeholders.
• The detailed reporting of the development of the 
intervention can serve as a model for future devel -
opment papers to increase transparency and reduce 
research waste.
• We focused on people with specific combinations 
of long-term chronic conditions (i.e., multimorbid -
ity), therefore, this intervention is tailored for this 
population.
• The intervention has been developed to be deliv -
ered in person, therefore, delivering this interven -
tion using other delivery modalities (e.g., digitally) 
may require amendments.
Background
Living with two or more chronic conditions (i.e., mul -
timorbidity) is common among people of all ages [1 , 
2]. Worldwide, approximately one-third of the popu -
lation lives with one or more chronic conditions [3 ]. 
People living with multimorbidity have poorer physical 
and psychosocial health, a higher risk of hospitalisa -
tion and of dying prematurely [4 –7]. The complexity of 
multimorbidity challenges the single-disease approach 
generally used by healthcare sectors, where patients 
use several healthcare services to manage each of their 
long-term conditions separately [8 , 9], which is inef -
ficient and burdensome for the patient [10]. Further -
more, available evidence for effective interventions of 
multimorbidity is limited [11]. A possible solution to 
deal with the complexity of managing multimorbidity is 
to focus on specific combinations of conditions, linked 
by common risk factors [12– 14]. This approach may 
also help improve care and treatment effects for this 
population [11].
Osteoarthritis (of the knee or hip), type 2 diabetes, 
depression, heart disease (heart failure or ischemic heart 
disease), hypertension, and chronic obstructive pul -
monary disease [15–22], are among the leading causes 
of global disability, affect hundreds of millions of peo -
ple around the world [23], and often coexist linked via 
systemic inflammation and physical inactivity [24, 25]. 
Treatment guidelines, while encouraging clinicians to 
recommend a healthy lifestyle (including exercise therapy 
and self-management) for people with multimorbidity, focus on pharmacology [26]. However, to our knowledge, 
there is no intervention which includes personalised 
exercise therapy and self-management support for people 
with multimorbidity, although these interventions may 
be as effective as for people with single chronic condi -
tions [27–29].
Therefore, the aim of this paper is to describe the 
development of a novel intervention (MOBILIZE) which 
includes personalised exercise therapy and self-manage -
ment for people with multimorbidity.
Methods
The development of the MOBILIZE intervention is 
reported following the GUIDance for the rEporting of 
intervention Development (GUIDED) recommendations 
(S1 Table) [30]. We followed the newest version of the 
Medical Research Council Framework [31] to develop the 
intervention supplemented with crucial elements from 
the Bleijenberg et al. [32] and O’Cathain et al. guidance 
[33]. This was done to improve the likelihood of devel -
oping an intervention feasible to deliver and accepted by 
patients living with multimorbidity to ultimately enhance 
the fit with clinical practice [31–33]. Overall, the devel -
opment of the intervention can be summarised in four 
phases: (I) “evidence synthesis and registry-based stud -
ies” where we summarised the available evidence regard -
ing the effect of exercise therapy and self-management 
for people with multimorbidity and identified predictors 
of health outcomes in such interventions, (II) “qualitative 
analyses” where we explored the perspectives of patients 
living with multimorbidity, health care professionals, 
relatives, and patient advocates in relation to self-man -
agement with a particular focus on exercise behaviour, 
(III) theories and mechanism of action for developing the 
intervention, where we hypothesised the potential mech -
anisms of action and created a logic model, and finally 
(IV) mixed-methods feasibility testing of the developed 
intervention. The full results of the feasibility study are 
reported elsewhere [34].
Patient and Public Involvement
The development of the MOBILIZE intervention 
included feedback from several stakeholders, that is, peo -
ple living with multimorbidity and their carers, patient 
advocates, physiotherapists and occupational therapists 
who are routinely working with patients with chronic 
conditions, a dietician, medical doctors specialised in the 
chronic conditions of interest, researchers with differ -
ent backgrounds (physiotherapists, an exercise physiolo -
gist, and a health psychologist). All the stakeholders were 
informed about the different stages of the development 
and asked to provide feedback when deemed relevant.

To determine how the body of evidence generated from 
the four phases of intervention development could be 
integrated into the intervention, the research team (AB, 
MJ, and STS) presented an initial program (based on the 
evidence gathered in phases (I) and (II)), to the physio -
therapists (MD, HR, MN, JRP , GZ, and KHA), the patient 
advocates and carers, and medical doctors. The structure 
of the programme was discussed, including the exercises 
proposed, progression/regression levels, and self-man -
agement themes. This approach was also used through -
out the development of the intervention, including 
during the feasibility study, and helped inform the final 
version of the intervention that is being tested in a ran -
domised controlled trial (RCT) (https:// clini caltr  ials. gov/ 
ct2/ show/ NCT04 645732). This approach strengthens the 
internal and external validity, minimises research waste, 
and adds value to health care research [31–33]. The fol -
lowing sections describe the development process of the 
intervention and how the intervention was adapted after 
qualitative and quantitative data on the feasibility study 
were gathered.
Results
Overall, we performed one scoping review [35], five sys -
tematic reviews [27, 36–40], two registry-based stud -
ies [41, 42], one qualitative interview study [43], and a 
mixed-methods feasibility study [34], to identify knowl -
edge gaps and develop an exercise therapy and self-man -
agement intervention for people with multimorbidity 
(Table 1) and Fig. 1.
Evidence synthesis
The reviews performed used the following Population, 
Intervention, Comparator and Outcome characteristics:
Population
Multimorbidity was defined as people reporting two 
or more of the following conditions: osteoarthritis (of 
the knee or hip), type 2 diabetes, depression, heart dis -
ease (heart failure or ischemic heart disease), hyperten -
sion, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These 
conditions are linked by a common risk factor (physical 
inactivity) and pathogenesis (systemic low-grade inflam -
mation), resulting in a cascade of reactions resulting in 
a ‘vicious cycle’ of chronic diseases and poor outcomes 
[44, 45]. For two systematic reviews, we included studies 
reporting at least 80% of the patients with multimorbid -
ity (as defined above) [27, 40]. This pragmatic approach 
was pre-specified [37], and adopted to capture all the 
studies which included people with multimorbidity, given 
the expected inconsistency of reporting of the conditions 
across trials.Interventions
Interventions that included exercise therapy and self-
management support, either alone or in combination. 
We did not apply restrictions to the mode of delivery of 
the interventions (e.g., digitally, face-to-face) and setting 
(e.g., municipality/community, hospital).
Comparators
Usual care, for instance, advice from their health care 
provider.
Outcomes
The outcomes of interest included physical (e.g. endur -
ance), psychosocial (e.g. health-related quality of life) and 
behavioural health (e.g. physical activity). The rationale 
for including these outcomes follows the guidance of a 
consensus study [14], which identified outcomes for mul -
timorbidity intervention studies, and the patient partners 
of MOBILIZE.
Registry‑based studies
Additionally, two registry-based studies were conducted 
to investigate the impact of comorbidities on health 
outcomes and to identify prognostic factors for health 
outcomes following an 8-week exercise and education 
programme in people with knee or hip osteoarthritis [41, 
42]. How the results of these studies informed the devel -
opment of the intervention are summarised in Table 1.
Qualitative analyses
A qualitative approach is particularly useful in captur -
ing how people are affected by a problem and their per -
spectives on it [33]. Therefore, the qualitative study we 
conducted aimed to explore the perspectives of people 
living with multimorbidity, health care professionals, 
relatives, and patient advocates concerning self-manage -
ment with a particular focus on exercise behaviour [43]. 
We conducted 17 interviews (nine focus groups; eight 
key informants) with 48 informants from four groups (22 
people living with multimorbidity, 17 health care pro -
fessionals, five relatives, and five patient advocates). The 
interviews were carried out online, informed consent was 
provided by the participants; the interviews were audio 
recorded and then transcribed verbatim. For the qualita -
tive and feasibility study [34], patients and relatives were 
recruited by healthcare professionals from one psychi -
atric hospital and four hospital departments in Region 
Zealand (one of five health care regions in Denmark) or 
via self-referral on the basis of a poster and flyers placed 
in the hospitals’ waiting rooms or through posts on the 
hospitals’ and patient organizations’ Facebook pages [43]. 
The focus groups and interviews were audio-recorded,

Study and design Aim of the study Main findings How this knowledge guided the development 
of the intervention
Bricca et al. 2019, 2020, 2021 (Systematic review 
protocol, systematic review, and infographic) 
[27, 36, 37]To investigate the benefits and harms of exer -
cise therapy for people with multimorbidity.Exercise therapy appears to be safe and to have 
a beneficial effect on physical and psychosocial 
health in people with multimorbidity. Although 
the evidence supporting this was of low quality, 
it highlights the potential of exercise therapy in 
the management and care of this population.Exercise therapy was deemed as a potentially 
beneficial intervention for people with multimor -
bidity supporting its use as part of an interven-
tion to improve health in people with multimor -
bidity. Given that no superior type of exercise 
therapy type was found to improve health, we 
discussed with stakeholders and patient partners 
the optimal type, dose, and intensity of the 
programme, considering patient preferences and 
the fact that it was easy to deliver and implement 
in clinical practice. The intervention details are 
reported in the TIDieR checklist incorporating 
the CERT items (Table 4), and Toigo & Boutellier 
checklist (S2 Table).
Harris et al. 2020 (systematic review) [40] To quantify recruitment, retention and dif-
ferential retention rates and associated trial, 
participant, and intervention characteristics in 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating 
the effect of exercise therapy in people with 
multimorbidity.Three in four eligible people with multimorbid-
ity were randomised to RCTs using exercise 
therapy, of which nine out of 10 provided end 
of treatment outcomes with no difference seen 
between the intervention and comparison 
groups. However, the results must be inter -
preted with caution due to large differences 
between the included studies.When planning the recruitment and retention 
phase, we used this knowledge to identify how 
many people were needed to be screened to 
reach the target number of people included in 
the feasibility study.
Pihl et al. 2021 (registry based) [42] To investigate if comorbidities are associated 
with change in health outcomes following an 
8-week exercise and education programme in 
knee and hip osteoarthritis.Health outcomes improved regardless of coex -
isting comorbidities. This means that comor -
bidities are not associated with worse nor better 
health outcomes following an 8-week exercise 
and education programme in individuals with 
osteoarthritis, suggesting exercise as a viable 
treatment option for individuals with osteoar -
thritis, irrespective of comorbidities.This knowledge supported the assumption that 
exercise therapy may be beneficial across people 
with several combinations of conditions, and 
no specific adaptation needs to be made for 
the subgroup of patients with OA and another 
condition.
Pihl et al. 2021 (registry based) [41] To identify prognostic factors for health 
outcomes following an 8-week supervised 
exercise therapy and education programme 
for individuals with knee and hip osteoarthritis 
alone or with concomitant hypertension, heart 
or respiratory disease, diabetes, or depression.Age, self-efficacy, self-rated health, and pain 
intensity may be prognostic of change in health 
outcomes following an 8-week exercise therapy 
and patient education programme for individu-
als with OA, irrespective of comorbidities.We focused our self-management support 
programme on providing tools to improve self-
efficacy, self-rated health and pain. The themes 
for the 24 self-management sessions are reported 
in Table 2.
Bricca et al. 2022 (systematic review) [39] To assess the quality of health Apps and their 
potential for behaviour change.Apps for people with a chronic condition or 
multimorbidity appear to be of acceptable 
quality but have low to moderate potential for 
promoting behaviour change.We selected the highest (free) quality health 
Apps, and those with the highest potential 
for behaviour change, available for people in 
Denmark and provide practical support for 
downloading or using such Apps during one of 
the self-management sessions.

Study and design Aim of the study Main findings How this knowledge guided the development 
of the intervention
Jäger et al. 2022 (scoping review) (under 
review) [35]To map the literature on patient-centred inter -
ventions for people living with multimorbidity 
that
supports self-management.The results pointed to an extensive use of cog-
nitive behavioural therapy as a basis for inter -
ventions, as well as behaviour change theories 
and chronic disease management frameworks. 
The most coded Behaviour Change Techniques 
(BCTs) stemmed from the categories Social 
Support, Feedback and Monitoring, and Goals 
and Planning.We considered which of the several BCTs used 
in RCTs were the most effective to promote 
behaviour change and which ones could be 
implemented in the clinical setting in which the 
intervention would be tested.
Bricca et al. 2022
(Systematic review) [38]To investigate the effect of behavioural inter -
ventions in people with multimorbidity and to 
identify Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs) 
associated with better outcomes.Behavioural interventions targeting lifestyle 
behaviours may improve health-related quality 
of life and physical function, and reduce depres-
sion symptoms, whereas little to no effect 
was achieved on physical activity and weight 
loss in people with multimorbidity. However, 
the evidence for physical activity and weight 
loss was of low quality and the end-treatment 
benefits diminished over time. Yet, studies using 
the BCTs ‘action planning’ and ‘social support 
(practical)’ reported greater physical activity and 
weight loss.These findings guided the developed of the the 
self-management sessions related to the impor -
tance of physical activity and how to implement 
it in daily routines (Table 3).
Zangger et al. 2022 (systematic review) (under 
review)To assess the effect of digital health solutions 
promoting physical activity among people with 
one or more chronic conditionsOverall, using a digital health solution shows a 
small improvement in physical activity, physical 
function, quality of life, and a small reduction in 
depressive symptoms, but no change in anxiety 
symptoms compared to usual care.We found low quality of evidence for the effect 
of digital solutions in promoting physical activity 
and improving health in people with multimor -
bidity. This knowledge guided the development 
of the self-management sessions related to self-
monitoring (Table 3).

transcribed verbatim and analysed in an inductive-
deductive process using Framework Analysis [46] and 
the Capability Opportunity and Motivation-Behaviour 
(COM-B) profile [47]. ,We found that people with mul -
timorbidity identified several barriers related to exercise 
behaviour (i.e., pain, fatigue, breathlessness, lack of moti -
vation, financial issues, accessibility, transportation, and 
decreased social support). Relatives’ perspectives illus -
trated an uncertainty concerning their role in supporting 
self-management while simultaneously showing that they 
often take over responsibilities, which may represent a 
burden on their own wellbeing. Therefore, strategies for 
overcoming barriers to exercise and the participation of 
relatives in the self-management sessions, as part of usual 
care, were included in the programme (Table  2). Fur -
thermore, patient advocates emphasised a need for more 
resources, such as establishing new collaborations and initiatives for people with multimorbidity and the lack 
of a ’burning platform’ for multimorbidity (i.e., lack of 
urgency and prioritization of multimorbidity in the soci -
ety) . Hence, this was included in the self-management 
session by informing the patients about activities, events, 
and organisations they could join (Table  2). Finally, health 
care professionals recognised these challenges while 
sharing their own challenges of empowering people with 
multimorbidity to change their behaviour given the lim -
ited resources. Therefore, this implied we instructed the 
physiotherapists delivering the intervention to prioritise 
strategies (i.e., behaviour change techniques) shown to 
be associated with better health outcomes in people with 
multimorbidity (Table  1) [38]. Overall, this knowledge, 
together with the self-management support framework 
[48], served to identify the core element of the 24 themes 
of the self-management sessions as well as the specific 
Table 2 Self-management themes of the 24, 30 minute sessions of the MOBILIZE intervention. Since participants are enrolled on a

content of the sessions (Table  2). The core elements of the 
self-management sessions were proposed by the author 
team to the patients and physiotherapists delivering the 
intervention, and this format was deemed acceptable and 
feasible by them.
Mechanism of action and theory to inform 
the development of the intervention
In this section, we report the possible mechanisms of 
action of the MOBILIZE intervention, which are sum -
marised in Fig.  2. Overall, we hypothesised that person -
alised exercise therapy and self-management support in 
addition to usual care (for instance, advice from their 
health care provider or any other treatment prescribed 
as standard care) will improve health-related quality 
of life more than usual care alone when measured at 12 
months with concurrent positive effects on secondary 
outcomes. Furthermore, we hypothesised those improve -
ments will occur immediately after the programme with 
concurrent positive effects on secondary outcomes and 
that the programme will be cost-effective at 12 months. 
We, therefore, aimed to develop an intervention that may 
potentially generate these effects Fig.  2. The knowledge 
gained from the four phases of intervention development 
guided us in identifying the core components of the exer -
cise therapy and self-management intervention, as sum -
marised in Table 1.
Anti‑inflammatory and physiological factors
The anti-inflammatory effects of exercise therapy at cel -
lular, tissue and organ level [44], as well as its positive 
physiological effects such as increase in muscle strength, 
improved blood pressure regulation and insulin sensitiv -
ity [49], highlight its potential role in improving health by 
reducing systemic inflammation.Psychosocial factors
Providing education about long-term chronic conditions, 
providing psychological and social support to adjust to 
life with chronic conditions, encouraging adherence to 
multiple treatments, and supporting activities of daily 
living and physical functioning may improve psychoso -
cial wellbeing [50, 51]. This can be achieved both through 
exercise therapy amd self-management sessions and as 
result of the psychological and social benefits associated 
with participation in group-based activities [51].
Contextual factors and expectations
Contextual factors, including the setting of the intervention 
[52], facilitator, patient and treatment features, as well as the 
patient-facilitator relationship [53], can influence health out -
comes positively or negatively. Therefore, much attention is 
given to ensuring such factors are addressed when deliver -
ing the intervention. The complete list of contextual factors 
and how they are considered in the MOBILIZE intervention 
can be found in the S3 Table. Furthermore, expectations are 
a large determinant of the placebo and nocebo effect [54]. 
A feasible strategy to increase patients’ realistic expectations 
is making sure the patients are aware of the health benefits 
of exercise therapy and self-management. We have therefore 
instructed the facilitators delivering the intervention to use 
strategies to set realistic expectations [54]. For instance, via 
adapting an authentic and empathic communication style 
when communicating and via educating patients on how to 
cope with possible adverse effects (e.g. muscle pain, fatigue, 
and shortness of breath), regularly assess and address 
patients’ anxieties, concerns, and treatment expectations, 
and provide adequate information regarding diseases, diag -
noses, and treatments [54]. Taken together, the contextual 
factors and expectations offer an opportunity to integrate 
strategies which may stimulate placebo effects and prevent 
nocebo effects [53].

Behavioural factors
Engaging in a healthier lifestyle is associated with up to 
6.3 years longer life expectancy for men and 7.6 years 
for women highlighting the role of a healthy lifestyle as a 
contributing factor to health [55]. Therefore, we included 
various Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs) [56] in the 
intervention (Table  3). BCTs are defined as observable, 
replicable, and irreducible components of an interven -
tion designed to alter or redirect causal processes that 
regulate behaviour. The rationale for using specific BCTs 
is based on the evidence synthesis results focusing on 
people with multimorbidity (Table  1) and previous litera -
ture investigating this topic given the low-certainty of the 
evidence for the association between BCTs and people 
with multimorbidity. For example, BCTs such as ‘ Action 
planning’ , ‘Self-monitoring’ and ‘Goal setting’ [56], are 
strongly associated with improved health behaviours in 
people without chronic conditions [57], and in people 
with one condition [55, 58–60].
In line with the BCT taxonomy instructions, we have 
only included the ‘active ingredients of the intervention’ . That is, the observable, replicable components aimed at 
changing a behaviour.
Personalisation of the MOBILIZE intervention
Prescribing the right treatment at the right time to the 
right patient is key to eliciting benefits and minimising 
harms. The exercise therapy and self-management con -
tent of the intervention has been developed to be per -
sonalised. The personalisation of the programme is set 
during a one-to-one session prior to initiating the pro -
gramme, lasting 60 minutes between each patient and a 
physiotherapist. The one-to-one session includes the fol -
lowing phases: (I) Presentation of the exercise therapy 
programme to the patient and selection of the appropri -
ate starting exercise levels, (II) Presentation of the cri -
teria for progression or regression of the exercises (e.g., 
the OMNI scale [61], and the Borg scale [62], and how 
sets and repetitions are progressed are presented so that 
the patient can indicate the degree of exertion of the 
exercises) and instructions on how to fill in the interven -
tion diary to record the exertion of the exercises, (III) Table 3 Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs) used in the MOBILIZE intervention and examples of their use

Table 4 Details of the MOBILIZE intervention: Personalised exercise therapy and self-management support programme
*Described according to the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) and the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template (CERT) items [67]Item Description
1. Brief name MOBILIZE Personalised exercise therapy and self-management support programme (RCT version)
2. Why There are no interventions, including personalised exercise therapy and self-management support for people with mul-
timorbidity, as highlighted by the evidence synthesys we performed, although such interventions are recommended by 
clinical guidelines for people with single long-term conditions.
3. What ‑materials For the exercise therapy sessions, elastic bands, treadmills, stationary bikes, kettlebells, gym balls, step boards and mats were 
used. For the self-management programme, a PowerPoint presentation supported by a manual for clinicians describing 
the intervention and including links, references and materials for patients to support self-management were used. The pro -
gramme only required exercise equipment available in most gyms of hospitals and municipalities, ensuring the feasibility of 
the future implementation of the intervention. The material will be made publicly available once finalised and evaluated in 
the randomised, controlled trial. The What-materials was informed by the evidence sysnthesys and qualitative interviews.
4. What ‑procedures The programme consists of 24 supervised exercise therapy sessions and 24 self-management sessions during the 12 weeks. 
This was deemed feasible and acceptable by patients and physiotherapists delivering the intervention. Before commencing 
the 12-week exercise programme, the patients are invited for a one-to-one assessment lasting 60 minutes where the physi-
otherapist delivering the intervention introduces the participant to the exercise therapy programme and sets the starting 
level for the exercises and the targeted intensity. The 12-week programme is supervised to ensure that the patients learn a 
certain skill set to self-manage their conditions and to initiate the behaviour change when it comes to for example physical 
activity (i.e., supporting them in understanding how and why they should continue exercising and being physically active).
The exercise therapy consists of a warm-up phase (e.g., on a stationary bike), followed by PART 1 (all together); Balance 
exercises and strengthening exercises for the lower and upper body, then PART 2 (participant’s own choice); Aerobic train-
ing, strength training or functional exercises, and finally a cool-down phase. The self-management programme combines 
individual and group activities and includes educational materials and videos, experiential exercises, and group discussions 
to equip patients with knowledge about chronic conditions and enable them to develop better self-management skills, set 
personal goals, and make action plans, identify challenges, and overcome them. At the end of the 12 weeks, the patients 
receive a video message on how to stay physically active and have a healthy lifestyle. This complements the self-manage -
ment session ‘After MOBILIZE’ .
5. Who ‑provided The exercise therapy and self-management programme are facilitated by physiotherapists, who received specific one-day 
training session and three online half-day sessions in study procedures, supported by the MOBILIZE team. This is in line with 
what is delivered in clinical practice in Denmark, for people with single chronic conditions.
6. How Delivered face to face (in-person) in small groups (max five patients) and individually and using different materials and 
videos as described under section 4.
7. Where In Region Zealand, Denmark: the Department of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy at Slagelse and Næstved Hos-
pitals, a private practice physiotherapy clinic in Holbæk and at rehabilitation centres in the municipalities of Roskilde and 
Lolland.
8. When and how much 24 (30-minute) self-management sessions followed by 24 (60-minute) supervised exercise therapy sessions delivered 
across 12 weeks with two sessions per week. Dosage (e.g., frequency, duration, intensity, level of severity) of the exercises 
were adapted to the patient’s abilities throughout the programme to support progression and continuous improvements 
in symptoms during the 12 weeks. The progression is guided using established tools such as the Borg scale of perceived 
exertion for aerobic exercise and the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines for strengthening exercises (e.g., the 
number of repetitions was added before increasing the number of sessions).
During the exercise therapy programme, patients and physiotherapists discussed subjects related to self-management and 
individual participant goals, including a session supporting long-term self-management and behaviour change.
9. Tailoring The programme is tailored to the characteristics, progression and improvements of the individual patient. Furthermore, the 
patients supported by the physiotherapists involved in the programme set individual goals that are followed up during the 
12-week program.
10. Modifications Not applicable, however, we will record whether modifications are needed during the testing of the intervention in the RCT 
as well as the type of modifications.
11. How well (planned) The facilitators of the programme attended a specific one-day course to be certified to deliver the treatment programme to 
ensure programme fidelity. While there is no clear recommendation on how to train the facilitators, the physios delivering 
MOBILIZE are expert in delivering exercise therapy and self-management, therefore one day course was deemed appropri-
ate and sufficient to deliver the intervention as intended. The programme focused on how to deliver and supervise the 
exercise therapy and self-management programme and support self-management and behaviour change in the individual. 
Adherence to the exercise and self-management sessions is measured by dividing the number of sessions attended by the 
total number of sessions offered. Monthly online fidelity meetings and in-person visits to the sites delivering the inter -
ventions are scheduled to assess fidelity. The focus of the fidelity meetings is to meet with the facilitators delivering the 
intervention to discuss the programme, including how it is being delivered at the sites and the success and the barriers/
challenges that have been experienced
12. How well (actual) Not applicable, however, we will record this as described in point 11.

setting of a Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, 
and Timely (SMART) goal (e.g., being able to walk the 
stairs without discomfort).
Preference and the content of the MOBILIZE intervention
Adherence to treatment is key to its effectiveness [63]. 
For people with multimorbidity, this is particularly chal -
lenging due to the high treatment burden they experience 
[64]. Having the option to receive treatments based on 
patient preferences may improve adherence to the treat -
ment and ultimately improve health [65]. Therefore, the 
MOBILIZE intervention allows patients to choose the 
type of exercise therapy (aerobic training, strength train -
ing, or functional exercises) to perform (Table  4). This 
decision was supported by the fact that people with mul -
timorbidity seem to benefit from exercise therapy inter -
ventions regardless of the type of exercise therapy [27], 
in line with the WHO guidelines for physical activity for 
general health [66].
Safety concerns
Behavioural interventions, including exercise therapy, 
are safe [68]. Although, in general, the risk of non-seri -
ous adverse events (according to the FDA definition 
[69], including short-lasting muscle pain and fatigue) 
may increase (19%), they do not increase the risk of seri -
ous adverse events such as hospitalisation and death 
[68]. Indeed, in people with multimorbidity they seem 
to reduce the risk of any serious adverse events by 38% 
[37]. However, the certainty of these findings in people 
with multimorbidity is low, mainly due to too few stud -
ies investigating this and the heterogeneous reporting 
of adverse events. Therefore, when developing the inter -
vention, we tried to identify the possible adverse events 
associated with exercise therapy by looking at systematic 
reviews of exercise therapy for single chronic conditions 
[15, 18–20, 22, 29, 49, 68], national clinical guidelines 
[70], and by regular meetings with medical doctors spe -
cialised in the single chronic conditions. Overall, in peo -
ple with one or more stable medical chronic conditions, 
it is contraindicated to exercise if they experience chest 
pain, uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes, irregular 
heartbeat, dizziness or sudden vision change [49]. We 
have instructed the facilitators delivering the interven -
tion to check these contraindications before initiating 
any new exercise therapy session.
The prototype of the intervention and amendments
Based on the evidence gathered and feedback from rel -
evant stakeholders (listed in the patient and public 
involvement paragraph), we developed an intervention 
consisting of 18 (60 minutes) sessions of personalised, 
group-based supervised exercise therapy, six sessions of 90 minutes of group-based self-management support and 
six sessions of home-based unsupervised exercise ther -
apy. The programme was designed to be delivered twice 
a week for 12 weeks and was tested in a mixed-methods 
feasibility study [34]. Briefly, the feasibility study showed 
the intervention was feasible and acceptable in people 
with multimorbidity in terms of recruitment rate, reten -
tion of outcomes at follow-up, outcome burden, adverse 
events, and qualitative feedback. Adherence to the home-
based unsupervised exercise therapy, however, was low 
and a few barriers were identified in the interviews sug -
gesting that some amendments were needed before pro -
ceeding to the RCT. For example, home-based exercise 
sessions were deemed challenging to complete by the 
patients, given the lack of supervision. Additionally, we 
discussed the option of splitting the self-management 
sessions into shorter but more frequent sessions to facili -
tate the uptake of the delivered information. Therefore, 
together with the physiotherapists, patient partners, pro -
ject managers, and researchers of the MOBILIZE team, 
we amended the intervention by increasing the number 
of the group-based supervised exercise therapy sessions 
to 24 and the number of the group-based self-manage -
ment sessions to 24.
Overall, each session of the intervention, which will be 
tested in a randomised controlled trial, lasts 90 minutes 
and includes 30 minutes of self-management support fol -
lowed by 60 minutes of supervised group-based exercise 
therapy delivered by a physiotherapist. The material will 
be made publicly available in the randomised controlled 
trial paper. The overall content of the intervention is pre -
sented in Table  4 following the Template for the TIDieR 
(Template for Intervention Description and Replication) 
[71], incorporating the CERT (Consensus on Exercise 
Reporting Template) items [67], and S2 Table, includ -
ing the mechano-biological descriptors of strengthening 
exercise therapy proposed by Toigo & Boutellier [72].
Discussion
This paper summarises the development of the MOBI -
LIZE intervention, which includes personalised exercise 
therapy and self-management support for people with 
multimorbidity. We followed the newest version Medical 
Research Council framework to develop the intervention 
[31], which targets people with multimorbidity and can 
be delivered in different settings at a relatively low cost 
as it uses material available in most gyms of hospitals, 
municipalities, and private physiotherapy clinics.
The evidence-based approach used to develop the 
MOBILIZE intervention together with the input from 
relevant stakeholders, resulted in an intervention for 
people with multimorbidity which includes compo -
nents aimed to elicit physiological, psychosocial, and 
Page 12 of 14 Bricca et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:244 
behavioural effects, considering contextual factors ulti -
mately leading to improved health. This is novel for 
people with multimorbidity who are usually treated phar -
macologically [26].
The iterative process used to develop and feasibility test 
the intervention helped us identify several challenges that 
could be addressed before the randomised controlled 
trial tests the effectiveness of the intervention. This is a 
key step in reducing waste in research [73].
The continuous interaction with key stakeholders 
to develop the MOBILZIE intervention in addition to 
improving the design of the intervention, aims to facili -
tate its implementation in clinical practice. While this 
approach has been acknowledged to be time-consuming, 
it is required when developing complex interventions 
aiming at improving people’s health behaviours [74].
Limitations
The limited quality of evidence (few studies with incon -
sistent results) supporting the use of exercise therapy and 
self-management in people with multimorbidity meant 
that many decisions taken regarding the type, duration, 
and intensity of the intervention were taken from evi -
dence of research for people with single chronic condi -
tions. However, the extensive qualitative work conducted 
as part of the development of the intervention and the 
constant feedback from the stakeholders helped to adapt 
this knowledge to people with multimorbidity. This will 
also improve the translation of our research into clinical 
practice if the MOBILIZE intervention is shown to be 
superior to usual care in the randomised controlled trial.
Conclusions
In this paper, we detail the development of a novel inter -
vention for people with multimorbidity. The MOBILIZE 
intervention, is currently being tested for its safety and 
effectiveness in a randomised controlled trial. The inter -
vention includes personalised exercise therapy and self-
management support to improve health-related quality 
of life and physical function by eliciting physiological, 
psychosocial, contextual, and behavioural factors. The 
development of the MOBILIZE intervention has high -
lighted the importance of using an iterative process sup -
ported by the involvement of several stakeholders to 
identify solutions to the challenges of developing com -
plex interventions.
