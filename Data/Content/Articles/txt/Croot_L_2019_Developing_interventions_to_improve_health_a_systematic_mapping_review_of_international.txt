Abstract
Background: Researchers publish the processes they use to develop interventions to improve health. Reflecting on
this endeavour may help future developers to improve their practice.
Methods: Our aim was to collate, describe, and analyse the actions developers take when developing complex
interventions to improve health. We carried out a systematic mapping review of empirical research studies that
report the development of complex interventions to improve health. A search was undertaken of five databases
over 2015 –2016 using the term ‘intervention dev* ’. Eighty-seven journal articles reporting the process of intervention
development were identified. A purposive subset of 30 arti cles, using a range of published approaches to developing
interventions, was selected for in-depth analysis using principles of realist synthesis to identify the actions of intervention
development and rationales underpinning those actions.
Results: The 87 articles were from the USA (39/87), the UK (32/87), continental Europe (6/87), and the rest of the world
(10/87). These mainly took a pragmatic self-selected approach ( n= 43); a theory- and evidence-based approach, e.g.
Intervention Mapping, B ehaviour Change Wheel ( n= 22); or a partnership approach, e.g. community-based participatory
research, co-design ( n= 10). Ten actions of inte rvention development were identif ied from the subset of 30 articles,
including identifying a need for an intervention, selecting th e intervention development approach to follow, considering
the needs of the target population, review ing published evidence, involving stakeholders, drawing or generating theory,
and designing and refining the intervention. Rationales for these actions were that they would produce more engaging,
acceptable, feasible, and effective interventions.
Conclusions: Developers take a variety of approaches to the international endeavour of complex intervention
development. We have identified and d escribed a set of actions taken within this endeavour regardless of whether
developers follow a published approach or not. Future develo pers can use these actions and t he rationales that underpin
them to help them make decisions about th e process of intervention development.

Background
Researchers develop interven tions to improve health. Re-
search funding agencies invest in this phase of research (e.g.
Medical Research Council Public Health Intervention De-
velopment Scheme https://mrc.ukri.or g/funding/browse/
public-health-intervention- development-scheme/public-
health-intervention-development-scheme-phind-july-2017/
), developers offer transparency by publishing the processes
they have undertaken [ 1,2], and scholars publish guides on
how to develop interventions [ 3–6]. Hoddinott [ 7]w e l -
comes the new era of intervention development studies,
proposing the definition as ‘[a] study that describes the ra-
tionale, decision making processes, methods and findings
which occur between the idea or inception of an interven-
tion until it is ready for formal feasibility, pilot or efficacy
testing prior to a full trial or evaluation ’(p. 1). Complex in-
terventions, with multiple interacting components [ 8,9],
are often the focus of intervention development studies.
The UK ’s Medical Research Council (UK MRC) pro-
duced internationally renowned guidance for the devel-
opment and evaluation of complex interventions [ 8,9].
It proposes four phases: development, feasibility and
piloting, evaluation, and implementation. The first phase
‘development ’is where the ‘intervention must be devel-
oped to the point where it can reasonably be expected to
have a worthwhile effect. ’(p. 2) [ 8]. This article focuses
on this development phase but recognises it may not
have a clear start and end point. Intervention develop-
ment is of interest to readers of this journal because it
so often overlaps with feasibility testing. It has been the
subject of a special issue of Pilot and Feasibility Studies
laying out the field- [ 7] and publishing-specific ap-
proaches [ 10,11] and a subsequent overview of ap-
proaches [ 12]. As Hoddinott points out, there is often a
grey area between this phase and the next phase of feasi-
bility and piloting because some exploration of the early
feasibility of delivering an intervention in a particular
context is often part of the intervention development
process [ 7].
There is also a grey area at the start of the intervention
development phase. Prior to an intensive developmentphase, developers may undertake a series of activities over
a number of years involving assessment of the evidence
base, qualitative research or engagement with key stake-
holders, or both. Alternatively, these activities may be
undertaken as part of the intensive development phase.
A methodological review of published approaches to
guide intervention development identified a taxonomy of
8 categories of approaches to intervention development
[12] and 18 actions proposed within them. Practice can
differ from the ideal scenarios recommended within
guides so it is important to understand how developers
undertake this endeavour in practice. This may highlight
the aspects of intervention development that are not ad-
dressed by current guides or are promoted within guides
but not used in practice. In addition, understanding the
rationales for developing an intervention in a particular
way may help to make transparent potential links be-
tween the way an intervention is developed and its sub-
sequent success in terms of being acceptable, feasible,
effective, implemented, and sustained in the real world
[13]. Prior to undertaking this review, there was an evi-
dence base on how intervention development is under-
taken in practice. However, reviews were undertaken in
specific contexts or for specific health conditions, e.g.
optimisation prior to a randomised controlled trial [ 14],
stroke care [ 15], and changing healthcare professional ’s
behaviour [ 16]. There was no evidence of how interven-
tions that aim to improve health are developed across a
range of contexts and conditions. The aim of this sys-
tematic mapping review was to collate and analyse the
actions taken by developers, and describe the rationales
for taking these actions, when developing complex inter-
ventions to improve health.
Methods
Design
We undertook this systematic mapping review as part of
a wider study ‘IdentifyiNg and assessing different ap-
proaches to DEveloping compleX interventions ’(the
INDEX study) [ https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr/
sections/hsr/mcru/indexstudy ]. A systematic mapping
review is a way of collating studies to answer questions re-
lating to the nature of evidence on a topic [ 17,18].
Their purpose is to collate, describe, and catalogue evi-
dence rather than to answer a specific question [ 17]. We
undertook a systematic mapping review of empirical re-
search studies reporting the development of complex in-
terventions to improve health in order to understand the
actions developers take in this endeavour. We were inter-
ested in the methods of the studies rather than their find-
ings. Guidance on reviewing methods identifies that
method-related sections of journal articles are a useful
source of information about methods and how they are
used [ 19]. We carried out a systematic search, screening,Croot et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:127 Page 2 of 13
cataloguing, and analysis of the method-relevant sections
of empirical research articles in two stages. The first stage
focused on describing the characteristics of all the in-
cluded articles and cataloguing them according to
O’Cathain et al. ’s eight categories of published approach
taken, for example, partnership or theory- and evidence-
based approaches [ 20]. The second stage involved select-
ing a purposive subset of articles ensuring coverage from
different categories of published approaches [ 17].
The proposal was registered with the International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO)
(registration number CRD 42017080553, see Additional file 1).
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines were followed [ 21].
Search strategy
We identified primary research studies using formal
database searches. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL,
PsycINFO, ASSIA, and ERIC databases using the
search term ‘intervention dev* ’with date parameters
for the 2-year period from January 2015 to December
2016. We undertook this search in January 2017 and
selected 2015 –2016 to understand the recent practice.
The full electronic search strategy for MEDLINE is
presented in Additional file 2. This search produced
417 unique hits.
Selection
The inclusion criteria were as follows:
–Journal articles reporting intervention development
or planned development within published protocols
–Articles published between January 2015 and
December 2016
–Interventions with a health-related outcome
–Development of a specific intervention, regardless of
whether an intervention was produced or not
–Articles that reported a part of the intervention
development process and positioned the work
explicitly as the development of a specific
intervention, for example, in their title
–Development activities occurring prior to a formal
feasibility/pilot phase
The exclusion criteria were as follows:
–Publication types: methodological reviews (but the
content of systematic reviews scanned for relevant
studies)
–Articles describing simple rather than complex
interventions, for example, development of drugs
and devices, surgical procedures, biomedical
screening, and those with non-human participants–Articles detailing refinement of interventions during
or following formal feasibility/pilot or evaluation
phases
–Primary research which was not carried out with the
explicit intention of developing an intervention
Screening
KS screened all 417 titles and abstracts. AOC and LC
double screened the first and last 25 abstracts taken
from the retrieved records database. Any differences in
opinion about inclusion were discussed and inclusion
criteria refined. One hundred eighty-one articles were
retrieved, and KS screened the full texts. Thirty-seven of
these were double screened by AOC or LC. A total of 87
papers were included after discussion by AOC, LC, and
KS, see Additional file 3for the list of 87 articles.
Quality assessment
In accordance with established methods for systematic
mapping reviews, the quality of the studies was not
assessed [ 17]. In addition, the focus of the analysis was
the actions taken, not the findings of the studies.
Cataloguing the studies
KS extracted information about the country of the first
author, setting, and disease/condition into an electronic
database for all 87 articles. KS, LC, and AOC categorised
the approach used in each article using the taxonomy of
8 categories identified in a systematic methods overview
of published approaches to intervention development
[20]. A ninth category was identified from the 87 arti-
cles: ‘pragmatic ’where developers did not reference the
use of any published approach but instead used a self-
selected set of actions, sometimes framed as ‘formative
evaluation ’or‘mixed methods ’. This 9-category tax-
onomy was used as a coding frame to guide our purpos-
ive sampling strategy to identify 30 articles for in-depth
analysis of the actions of development and the rationales
for those actions (see Table 1).
Analysis of a subset of studies
A subset of 30 articles was selected purposively to maxi-
mise variation by selecting articles from different categor-
ies and sub-categories in an intervention development
taxonomy (Table 1). The analysis of this subset was in-
formed by the principles of realist reviewing [ 22]. Realist
reviewing is a theory-driven approach that we selected to
provide an explanatory analysis of intervention develop-
ment processes. In a realist review, the unit of analysis is
the explanation about how something works and the
conditions that affect how it works [ 23]. Reviewers specify
the context (C) and the outcome (O) of an intervention,
along with the mechanisms (M) by which the intervention
is assumed to affect the outcome. These relationships areCroot et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:127 Page 3 of 13
often depicted in Context-Mechanism-Outcome Configu-
rations (CMOCs) [ 24]. Typically, realist reviews focus on
the mechanisms of interventions whereas our focus was
on the processes of intervention development. For our
review, the actions used to develop the intervention were
equivalent to the context in a more traditional realist re-
view (C), and the rationale for each action was the mech-
anism (M) by which developers hoped to improve the
likelihood of success of the resultant intervention (O). For
example, in one of our included articles, an intervention
was developed in consultation with those targeted by the
intervention (action/context) because the developers be-
lieved that interventions should be tailored to the specific
needs of the particular population and setting to ensure a
match between the needs of the target population and the
intervention (rationale/mechanism) because this means
that the intervention is more likely to be appropriate and
acceptable, and therefore, the target population is more
likely to engage with it, which means it is more likely to
be successful (outcome) [ 25]. Authors did not always
make their rationales explicit, and in these cases, we iden-
tified any implicit rationales for an action described in any
parts of the articles. As the interventions were untested, itwas not possible to determine the actual impact of the ac-
tions on the resultant success of the final intervention
(outcome). Instead, we developed a set of statements that
described the assumptions made by the developers.
In-depth data analysis began with four articles that re-
ported using Intervention Mapping [ 3] as the approach
to intervention development. We chose to start with
Intervention Mapping because it provides a clear outline
of six steps for intervention development [ 3]. The four
articles reported all six steps between them, although
not all articles described using all the steps. They also
described how they took each action. We developed a
preliminary thematic framework using these steps as ac-
tions of intervention development. LC extracted the ac-
tions, and how developers addressed these actions, into
a Word table.
Next, we selected articles from the 10 categorised as
using a partnership approach to intervention develop-
ment because these offered a contrast to Intervention
Mapping. Using an approach similar to constant com-
parison [ 26], LC compared the actions of development
with those already in the framework, adding and refining
the framework in discussion with AOC and KS. EarlyTable 1 Mapping the approaches used according to an intervention development taxonomy (see O ’Cathain et al. [ 12]

iterations of the framework included actions such as
deciding on the health issue to be addressed and identi-
fying antecedents of the problem. LC and KS then con-
tinued the data extraction independently for articles in
the theory- and evidence-based category. Next, articles
from the largest group labelled ‘pragmatic ’were selected
and added to the framework. Finally, some articles from
the smaller of the 9 categories were included. Dual
extraction was undertaken on 13 articles in total, and
the analysis was continually refined based on team dis-
cussions resulting in an inductively developed frame-
work of the key actions taken by developers in practice
during intervention development.
LC and KS documented CMOCs for each action in
each article separately within a Word table. The CMOCs
for each action were then synthesised and refined to cre-
ate a smaller number of higher-level statements which
summarised the rationales from these CMOCs for each
action.
Results
Eighty-seven articles were included in the mapping
review, and a subset of 30 articles was selected for
further analysis (Fig. 1), see Additional file 3for the list
of included studies.
Description of articles
The included 87 articles were written by lead authors
based in the USA (39), the UK (32), other European
countries (6), and the rest of the world (10). The major-
ity (82%) were from the USA or the UK. The majority of
the articles related to an intervention for a community
setting including self-management (57). Other settings
included hospital (19), general practice (8), school (5),
workplace (3), prison (1), or military (1). Seven articles
related to an intervention for more than one of these
settings, for example, Webb et al. [ 27] developed an
intervention targeting nurses working in either hospital
or general practice settings. Many articles reported the
development of digital interventions (30) including videos,
web-based materials, and mobile phone applications. We
classed the majority of these as community setting because
the target population could choose to use them anywhere.
Interventions focussed on a wide range of conditions in-
cluding cancer (10), obesity/diet/weight management (11),
mental health (10), sexual health (7), HIV (6), sedentary
behaviour (6), substance misu se (5), and intimate partner
violence (3). In some cases, interventions focussed on more
than one condition, for example, Miller et al. [ 28] developed
an intervention to improve the mental health of cancer
survivors. A small number of interventions were aimed
at health professional behaviour change to improve im-
plementation and use of a new process, pathway, or
intervention (5).A wide range of approaches to intervention develop-
ment was used, with a pragmatic approach accounting
for half of the articles (Table 1). Allocation of articles to
the taxonomy of approaches was straightforward for
some sub-categories, such as Intervention Mapping, but
challenging for articles that did not specify a referenced
approach, that is, pragmatic sub-categories.
Actions reported in a subset of 30 articles
We identified ten actions (see Table 2). Actions were re-
ported in different orders in different articles.
Action 1: Identify a need for an intervention
Developers documented why a new intervention was
needed through reference to the research literature [ 29],
healthcare policy [ 10], their own expertise in research
[30] or practice [ 31], previous research findings [ 32],
consultation with community members [ 33], or a com-
bination of these [ 34]. The rationale for this was to jus-
tify the development of a new intervention by identifying
an unmet health need. In most cases, developers selected
the health issue to focus on, but some developers used
partnership approaches with communities to identify
and prioritise health issues. For example, Njeru et al.
[35] were part of a long-establi shed community-academic
partnership. This partnership had developed a community-
based research infrastructure to enable community and
academic partners to conduct every phase of research
together. They identified type II diabetes as a priority area
for intervention.
Identifying the health issue was important to establish
the type of intervention needed. In some cases, no
effective interventions existed for that health issue, and a
new intervention was identified as necessary. For
example, Theeke and Mallow [ 36] recognised the link
between loneliness and poor health but noted existing
loneliness interventions showed limited effectiveness and
sustainability, so a new intervention was needed. In
other cases, an effective intervention existed but was not
implemented by practitioners, so an intervention to ad-
dress implementation was needed. For example, Connell
et al. [ 37] identified intensive repetitive task-orientated
training as an effective intervention to promote recovery
of upper limb function following a stroke but noted it
was not carried out in practice, so they set out to de-
velop an intervention to improve its implementation.
Action 2: Select the intervention development approach
Developers who used published approaches to interven-
tion development often justified this in the introduction of
their articles. Their explicit rationales for using published
approaches were that they provided systematic and trans-
parent processes for combining theory, published evi-
dence, and new data. For example, Heath et al. [ 38]Croot et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:127 Page 5 of 13
selected Intervention Mapping (Bartholomew et al. [ 39])
because it is ‘a problem-driven approach which combines
one or multiple theories, empirical evidence and new
research to develop behaviour change interventions ’
(p. 1229).
When developers took a pragmatic approach, that is,
did not follow a published approach, they framed it in
diverse ways. Sometimes, the descriptions of the ap-
proach were inconsistent throughout the article, show-
ing the challenge of describing approaches clearly. For
example, Marsac et al. [ 40] described incorporating
evidence-, theory-, and a user-centred design andreferred to this as ‘systematic, theoretically grounded
development ’in their title (p. 12) and ‘systematic and
empirically grounded (p. 16) in the body of their art-
icle. Other developers sometimes drew on wider re-
search designs rather than intervention development
approaches to offer a set of steps for their approach to
intervention development because this offered a system-
atic and transparent description of their approach. For ex-
ample, Golin et al. [ 41] cited Linnan and Steckler ’s[42]
work on process evaluation as a source of best practice for
intervention development and then presented a diagram
of three phases and steps they took.Fig. 1 PRISMA diagramCroot et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:127 Page 6 of 13
Action 3: Consider the needs and circumstances of the
target population
Most developers identified the target population in the
introduction section of their articles. The rationale for
identifying the target population at an early stage was to
allow developers to consider the needs and circumstances
of that population in order to ensure the subsequent inter-
vention was accessible, acceptable, and relevant to them.
Developers identified the target population by referring to
research literature highlighting a problem for that specific
population and by referring to their previous research (e.g.
Martin et al. [ 32]), national or international policy (e.g.
Morrison et al. [ 43]), or pragmatic reasons for their deci-
sion to target a particular population. For example, Golin
et al. [ 41] described the pragmatic reasons related to ac-
cess to the population and potential reach of the interven-
tion, which led them to target their intervention to a
demographically diverse group of HIV-infected, English-
speaking men and women, in 2 months before and
3 months after release from prison. In contrast, a smallnumber of articles identified the target population during
the development process. For example, Cadogan et al. [ 44]
developed three draft interventions to improve appro-
priate polypharmacy in older people in primary care
targeting patients, general practitioners, and commu-
nity pharmacists. The res earch team then screened each
draft intervention using the Affordability, Practicability,
Effectiveness and cost-effect iveness, Acceptability, Side
effects/safety and Equity (APEASE) criteria [ 45]a n ds e -
lected general practitioners as the target population for
the planned intervention. When the intervention aimed
to increase implementation of an existing intervention,
the target population was not those directly affected by
the health issue. For example, Steinmo et al. [ 46]s e t
out to improve the implementation of the ‘Sepsis Six ’
c a r eb u n d l e[ 47] because the target for use of the Sepsis
Six bundle had not been reached within a UK hospital.
In this instance, they viewed the target population as
those in a position to implement ‘Sepsis Six ’rather than
patients receiving the bundle.Table 2 Summary of actions taken in intervention development and their rationales
Action Rationales (based on the 30 articles in the subset)
1. Identify a need for an intervention Interventions that meet a recognised health need are more likely
to be implemented and used in the real world
2. Select the intervention development approach Published approaches are systematic and transparent and therefore
are more likely to lead to effective interventions
3. Consider the needs and circumstances of the
target populationWhen interventions take into account the needs and circumstances
of the target population, they are more likely to be accessible,
acceptable, and relevant to that population, who then are more
likely to engage and adhere to them
4. Determine the level(s) that the intervention will
target, i.e. individual, organisational, environmentalIdentifying the nature and potential impact of interactions between
the intervention and different levels of influence allows the development
of components to facilitate, mitigate, or mediate these interactions
5. Identify in-depth understanding of the setting
for delivering the interventionIn-depth understanding of the setting is more likely to lead to credible
solutions to delivering the intervention, which in turn may lead to an
intervention that is feasible to implement in that setting, and therefore
more likely to be implemented in the real world if found to be effective
6. Review published evidence on existing interventions Research wastage associated with unnecessary new intervention
development may be reduced if interventions are based on existing
interventions or components shown to be effective in different contexts
and adapted for a different health issue, population, or setting
7. Involve stakeholders If relevant perspectives are used to shape the intervention, then it is
more likely to be relevant, culturally appropriate, credible, and acceptable
to those delivering or receiving the intervention, leading to implementation
and engagement in the real world if found to be effective
8. Draw on existing theory and/or generate
intervention-specific theory (programme theory)Theory can help to identify relevant intervention components likely be
effective in the target population, and it can illustrate how inputs produce
outcomes to enable replication and evaluation of the impact of the
intervention
9. Design the intervention Designing an intervention that is feasible and acceptable to those delivering
it and accessible to the target population leads to an intervention that is
more likely to be implemented and used in the real world if found to
be effective
10. Refine the intervention by assessing early
feasibility and acceptability with stakeholdersObtaining feedback on early versions of the intervention is more likely to
produce a final intervention that is feasible and acceptable and therefore
more likely to be used by the target population and implemented in
the real worldCroot et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:127 Page 7 of 13
Action 4: Determine the level(s) that the intervention will
target, i.e. individual, organisational, and environmental
Some developers determined the level(s) the intervention
would influence at the outset, stating this in the intro-
duction of the article, whereas others did this during the
development process. The rationale for selecting the
intervention level(s) was to guide the choice of compo-
nents and to consider the interplay between these. For
example, Mackenzie et al. [ 25] cited Gilson et al. ’s[48]
suggestion that interventions should address multiple
levels of influence, and set out to develop a multi-level
intervention to reduce workplace sitting in a university
department. They carried out a focus group with 13
members of their target population to identify appropri-
ate intervention content to address individual, social,
environmental, and organisational levels of influence.
Some developers identified multiple levels of influence
but chose to focus on only one of these levels. Ingholt
et al. [ 49] developed an intervention to improve stu-
dents ’social relations in order to reduce dropout from
vocational schools along with smoking and drug use.
They identified existing interventions targeting individ-
ual students but found that little attention had been
given to schools themselves, and so, they chose to focus
their intervention at the organisational level of school.
Action 5: Identify in-depth understanding of the setting for
delivering the intervention
The rationale for identifying the setting for delivery was
to allow developers to explore opportunities and con-
straints that could affect the feasibility and acceptability
of delivering or receiving an intervention in that setting.
The decision to develop an intervention for a particular
setting was usually described in the introduction section
of articles. This decision was based on the following: the
location of the target population, for example, an inter-
vention targeting recently incarcerated individuals with
HIV was set in prisons and community-based HIV ser-
vices [ 41]; the preferences of the target population, for
example, Poleshuck et al. [ 50] used a participatory ap-
proach in which the members of the target population
identified an existing women ’s health clinic as the setting
for their intervention to improve the health of survivors
of intimate partner violence; a gap in the evidence base,
for example, a lack of weight management programmes
delivered solely by GPs in primary care in Australia [ 10];
or the interests and expertise of the research team, for
example, Ingholt et al. [ 49] had previously completed a
fieldwork in vocational schools in Denmark.
In some cases, the setting was a critical factor in iden-
tifying potential interventions. For example, Rothman
and Wang [ 31] set out to develop an intervention to reduce
dating abuse perpetration to b e delivered in a hospital set-
ting. They identified a brief, motivational interview-styleintervention shown to be effective in reducing youth alco-
hol and marijuana use in a hospital setting and decided to
adapt this to reduce adolescent dating abuse in the same
setting. In some articles, the setting for delivery was not
relevant, for example, when developers were producing an
online intervention [ 51].
Action 6: Review published evidence on existing
interventions
The rationale for this was to reduce research wastage as-
sociated with unnecessary intervention development.
Many developers reviewed the existing literature in the
introduction section of articles to establish the need for
a new intervention [ 40] or to identify effective interven-
tions, or components of existing interventions, that
might be adapted or used for a different health issue
[52], target population [ 29], or setting [ 53]. In a small
number of articles, developers began by exploring the
health issue in more detail to identify contributory or
causal processes or pathways before searching the litera-
ture for existing interventions, or components of inter-
ventions, to address these. For example, Charles et al.
[54] described the early-stage development of an inter-
vention to improve psychosocial and behavioural health
outcomes amongst children with fathers with a history
of incarceration. They began by reviewing the literature
to understand the health issue in more detail and made
three observations. First, that the complex characteristics
and needs of fathers should act to increase, not preclude,
calls for a supportive service. Second, that developing fa-
thers ’knowledge and parenting skills would be central
to any intervention. Third, that fathers ’involvement
could be improved by explicitly involving mothers and
extended family in intervention efforts. They then
reviewed the literature to select programme components
from two manualised, previously evaluated interventions
that addressed these observations.
Action 7: Involve stakeholders
The rationale for involving stakeholders was to enable
developers to consider different perspectives in order to
improve the potential fit between the intervention and
the contexts in which it would be used. Stakeholders
were people with interest, influence, expertise, or other
concern in the intervention, health problem, target
population, or setting. The examples included health
and social care providers [ 55], academics [ 54], represen-
tatives of third sector organisations [ 32], members of the
target population [ 25], policymakers [ 50], and advocates
and gatekeepers to the target population [ 56]. Decisions
reported about stakeholder involvement included who to
include, the duration of involvement, and the nature and
purpose of the involvement.Croot et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:127 Page 8 of 13
Developers reported working with stakeholders in dif-
ferent ways. Some established stakeholder groups from
the outset or included stakeholders in the development
team, so that they were involved in decisions about the
overall intervention development endeavour for the dur-
ation of the process. Others consulted one or more
groups of stakeholders episodically during the develop-
ment of the intervention. Poleshuck et al. [ 50] did both.
They convened an executive committee of researchers,
representatives of the target population, and service pro-
viders to guide and oversee the intervention develop-
ment endeavour throughout the process. This group
then convened a community advisory board made up of
survivors of violence (members of the target population),
health professionals, academics, and policymakers to
contribute to the design and content of their interven-
tion. In this example, the executive group oversaw how
the intervention would be developed, and the commu-
nity advisory board brought a range of perspectives to
discussions about the content, format, and delivery of
the intervention at particular stages.
Some stakeholder groups included members of the tar-
get population —those at whom the intervention was
aimed —and others did not. For example, Vaughn et al.
[34] collaborated with the members of the target popula-
tion in their ‘community-engaged ’study to identify strat-
egies to address obesity, stress, and coping amongst the
Latino immigrant community in Ohio. They stated that
this engagement with the target population was neces-
sary to develop strategies that were contextually and cul-
turally appropriate. Developers working with high levels
of stakeholder involvement identified a concern that the
developed intervention might have limited transferability
beyond the setting or group that contributed to its
development. For example, Steinmo et al. [ 46] observed
that their collaborative approach was an important
strength and a significant lever to the success of the
intervention because it allowed the intervention to be
shaped to the specific context; however, it was also a
limitation because they could not draw conclusions
about feasibility in other hospitals.
Action 8: Draw on existing theory and/or generate
intervention-specific theory
Developers referred to theory in different ways. Some
identified existing mid-range theories (see Davidoff et al.
[23] for definition) in the introduction of the article, for
example, social practice theory [ 49], social-ecological
theory [ 34], and the theory of planned behaviour [ 31].
The rationale for drawing on existing theory was that
this would lead to interventions that were more likely to
be effective. Developers of behaviour change interven-
tions sometimes referred to frameworks of theories, e.g.
the Behaviour Change Wheel [ 45] because they provideda systematic way of analysing behaviour and a compre-
hensive list of behaviour change techniques to consider
[29,44]. The rationale for this was to bring transparency
to the process of development and allow for accurate
replication and evaluation of the intervention mecha-
nisms [ 53,55].
Theory generation was an alternative or additional
approach to using existing theory. Some developers de-
scribed how they synthesised evidence from different
sources to develop a programme theory specific to their
intervention (e.g. Ford et al. [ 57]). The rationale for the
intervention-specific theory was that theories should be
tailored to the context in which they are being used.
Developers used different methods to gather evidence to
inform this programme theory. Many carried out sys-
tematic reviews of the literature to explore the health
problem (e.g. Gray-Burrows et al. [ 58]). Others identified
behavioural targets through consultation with stake-
holders (e.g. Steinmo et al. [ 46]), from qualitative research
with the target population (e.g. Mummah et al. [ 59]), or
from a combination of all of these (e.g. Simonsen et al.
[33]). Programme theory generated during development
was sometimes articulated in a logic model specific to the
intervention (e.g. Golin et al. [ 41]).
The weight given to a theory differed between articles.
At the outset, some developers gave a detailed account
of how the chosen theories or frameworks would inform
development, whereas others gave little attention to this.
For example, Golin et al. [ 41] described how the core te-
nets of social cognitive theory [ 60] and the information-
motivation-behavioural skills model (Fisher et al. [ 61])
related to antiretroviral adherence in recently incarcer-
ated individuals. They supported their choice of theory
by referring to existing empirical evidence of the effect-
iveness of similar interventions, and later, they used a
conceptual model to show the integration of these theor-
ies into their intervention. In contrast, Katz and Paskett
[56] described their intervention as ‘theoretically based ’
(p. 445) but referred to theory in just one sentence.
Some developers did not refer explicitly to the theory at
all, articulating some of their programme theory without
using the term theory.
The point at which developers selected an existing the-
ory varied. In some cases, developers selected an existing
theory or theories prior to starting the development
process whereas others began development and identi-
fied relevant theory as part of this process. For example,
Vaughn et al. [ 34] describe how their study was ‘based
on a framework of social-ecological theory ’(p. 838) [ 62],
and this informed their work to integrate multiple per-
spectives to understand the contextual and cultural nu-
ances of their target population. In contrast, Theeke and
Mallow [ 36] set out to develop an intervention to target
the cognitive processes associated with loneliness. TheyCroot et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:127 Page 9 of 13
carried out a literature review about loneliness and iden-
tified two distinct intervention targets: the dysfunctional
thinking associated with loneliness and the lack of a
meaningful role described by people with loneliness. The
team then selected theories that could be used to
develop and implement an intervention to target these
cognitive processes.
Action 9: Design the intervention
Developers made decisions about the components of the
intervention and how to present and deliver these com-
ponents, thinking about who would deliver them, how
often, and for how long. The rationale for this was that
interventions were more likely to be successful if the tar-
get population can access and engage with them, and
they are more likely to be implemented if they are feasible
and acceptable to those who will deliver them. Some devel-
opers made some of these decisions at the outset. For ex-
ample, Smith et al. [ 63] chose to develop a mobile cancer
prevention application targe ting African-American breast
cancer survivors because African-Americans have the high-
est smartphone ownership of al l ethnic groups. In contrast,
other developers identified the mode of delivery during
intervention development. For example, Gray-Burrows
et al. [ 58] developed a logic model for their intervention to
reduce dental caries by promoting parental-supervised
tooth brushing and then iden tified programme components
and modes by which these could be delivered within the
existing provision. Some developers took a creative ap-
proach to identifying options for the intervention, engaging
in group discussion sessions they called ‘ideation ’[59].
Some interventions required technical expertise to
produce the intervention. In some cases, the developers
generated the intervention content and used third party
technical expertise to design the resultant intervention
product. For example, Sturgiss and Douglas [ 10] employed
a graphic designer to improve the usability and attractive-
ness of the documents they produced for general practi-
tioners using their intervention. In contrast, Mummah
et al. [ 59] included technical developers within their devel-
opment team to integrate design thinking throughout the
development process.
Action 10: Refine the intervention by assessing early
feasibility and acceptability with stakeholders
Many interventions were refined during development, it-
eratively and collaboratively with target users and other
stakeholders before the formal feasibility and piloting
stages. The rationale was that incorporating the views
and preferences of stakeholders on early versions would
improve the feasibility and acceptability of the resultant
intervention. Developers producing digital interventions
tested prototypes with users during development specific-
ally to assess functionality (readability, ease of navigation),engagement, and acceptability. For example, Marsac et al.
[40] produced a prototype of their digital intervention
‘Coping Coach ’for children affected by acute medical
trauma, which they tested with users, refined based on this
test, and then retested. A number of technical difficulties
were identified with prototype 1, and major revisions were
made to produce prototype 2. Small numbers of the target
population assessed the first prototype ( n= 9), and larger
numbers tested the second prototype ( n= 33). The au-
thors stated that by systematically evaluating the interven-
tion during the development process, they could optimise
the design based on user feedback and reduce time and
development costs. Developers assessed early feasibility
and acceptability by working with a stakeholder group or
by carrying out qualitative or quantitative research with
members of the target population, those who would be de-
livering the intervention, or both. Some developers tested
prototypes or drafts of individual components of the inter-
vention (Marsac et al. [ 40]) whereas others tested the
whole intervention, resulting in refinements to both the
intervention and its delivery (e.g. McMillen et al. [ 64],
Sturgiss and Douglas [ 10]), before moving on to feasibility
and pilot testing.
Rationales
For each action, rationales within the 30 articles were
identified and summarised within a single statement (see
Table 2).
Discussion
Summary of findings
Publishing how interventions were developed is a com-
mon and international endeavour. Developers take very
different approaches, including following published ap-
proaches or determining their own set of actions. Ten ac-
tions of intervention development were identified from
the subset of 30 papers, including identifying a need for an
intervention, selecting the intervention development ap-
proach to follow, considering the needs of the target
population, reviewing published evidence, involving stake-
holders, drawing on theory, designing the intervention,
and refining the intervention. Few articles reported all the
actions undertaken, and a small number covered only 1 or
2 actions in considerable detail. Developers also gave dif-
ferent weight to the actions they reported. Rationales for
these actions were that they would produce more accept-
able, feasible, and effective interventions.
Strengths and limitations
The strength of this work lies in the detailed account of
the reported actions taken during intervention develop-
ment and the rationales for those actions, drawing on
real-world practice. There were 6 limitations. First, the
search term used to identify studies was simple and mayCroot et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:127 Page 10 of 13
not have identified all reports of intervention develop-
ment published in this timeframe. To consider the effect
of this, we undertook a second search with a wider range
of terms in the same databases: complex behavioural
intervention, develop, design, phase 1, exploratory, re-
fine, and translate. We selected the first 100 records and
then 1 in every 8 records of the 808 records retrieved.
We conducted a title and abstract screen on these 189
records and identified 26 relevant articles. This did not
identify further categories or sub-categories of interven-
tion development reported in Table 2. Second, we did
not search the grey literature, and doing so may have
identified accounts of interventions not published in an
academic journal. Third, this is a rapidly developing
field, and although the included articles were published
in 2015 and 2016, the development activity took place
earlier than this, and so published accounts may not
fully represent recent innovation in this area. Fourth, it
was important to sample from each category which we
did; however, it is possible that by not sampling from
each sub-category, we may have missed an action. In
addition, a different research team might have purpos-
ively selected a different subset of 30 papers for in-depth
analysis. For example, we noticed in hindsight that we
did not include 2/87 articles from lower- and middle-
income countries in the in-depth analysis. Fifth, we
attempted to identify the rationale for undertaking ac-
tions. It is important to note that these were assump-
tions and we did not follow up the interventions to
assess whether the interventions developed had indeed
been effective. A recent systematic review attempted to
examine the link between the use of one of the actions
in our analysis —theory —and the effectiveness of the
subsequent interventions and concluded that the use of
theory was not associated with effective interventions
[65]. Therefore, we offer these actions and rationales as
hypotheses for future testing. Finally, although we
present the findings to illustrate real-world practice, re-
searchers often have to offer cleaned-up versions of their
practice and may not always document everything in
their papers so that readers can easily understand the
content and reporting fits the template for articles
within specific journals.
Placing the research in the context of other evidence
There was considerable overlap between the 10 actions
identified here and 18 actions described in a systematic
methods overview of published approaches to intervention
development [ 20]. There were differences in how the ac-
tions in the different reviews were described, rather than
actual differences between the sets of actions. Some ac-
tions appeared in this review that would not be expected
to appear in actions based on published approaches, in
particular, selecting which published approach to take.O u rf i n d i n g sw e r es i m i l a rt ot h o s eo fo t h e rr e s e a r c h e r s
who had reviewed practice in the more specific areas of
nursing [ 66], changing health professionals ’behaviour
[13], and behaviour change for chronic conditions [ 67].
Conclusion and implications
Within this mapping review, we described actions taken
in practice by those developing interventions in a range
of contexts, illustrating them with examples. The review
adds to a growing body of evidence identifying a similar
set of actions in specific contexts. Many developers did
not follow guidance encapsulated in published ap-
proaches to intervention development but nonetheless
undertook actions recommended by those approaches.
Developers varied in how they undertook these actions.
This mapping review of practice will be useful to those
planning intervention development so they can under-
stand how others have done this and the rationales for
the choices they have made. We plan to use the findings
from the review together with other evidence to con-
struct guidance on how to develop interventions. There
remains a knowledge gap about the relationship between
these actions and the success or otherwise of the result-
ant interventions.
