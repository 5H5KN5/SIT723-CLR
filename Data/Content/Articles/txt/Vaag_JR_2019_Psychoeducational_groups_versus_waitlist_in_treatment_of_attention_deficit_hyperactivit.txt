Abstract
Background: Psychoeducation is included in the Norwegian national guidelines for treatment of adult ADHD.
D e s p i t es o m ep r o m i s i n gr e s u l t sf o rt h et r e a t m e n to fo t h e rc o n d i t i o n sa n dA D H D ,l i t t l ei sk n o w na b o u tt h e
efficacy of such interventions. This paper presents a protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial featuring
a psychoeducational group program for patients wit h ADHD. The main objective of this pilot trial is to
investigate adherence, feasibility, and preliminary effi cacy of a ten-session psychoeducational group designed
to address specific challenges faced by adults diagnosed with ADHD.
Methods: This pilot study will evaluate patient satisfaction and preliminary efficacy of a psychoeducational
group treatment using a randomized waitlist-controlled trial at two different outpatient clinics in mid-Norway.
All participants will receive treatment as usual, concom itant with the intervention and waitlist period. Client
satisfaction (CSQ 8), general self-efficacy (GSE-6), ADHD-related quality of life (AAQoL), symptoms of ADHD
(SCL-9; ASRS), and work participation will be assessed at the time of recruitment prior to randomization (T0),
pre-intervention (T1), post-interv ention (T2), and at 10 weeks follow-up (T3). Recruitment and dropout rates
along with treatment adherence will also be evaluated.
Discussion: This study offers valuable insight into the preliminary efficacy of educational programs implemented in
outpatient clinics. The aim of the trial is to evaluate adherence, feasibility, patient satisfaction, and the preliminary
efficacy of a psychoeducational group intervention for patients with adult ADHD and provide further insight into the
design and construction of a large-scale trial. The resu lts also offer preliminary empirical evidence to inform
the development of larger and more complex studies.

Background
ADHD is a common disorder [ 1] that continues from
childhood into adulthood in 30 to 60% of cases [ 2,3]. In
a large multinational study, the average prevalence rate
has been estimated to be 3.4% among adults [ 4]. ADHD
is characterized by difficulties with regard to attention,
hyperactivity, and impulsivity. In addition to these per-
sistent problems, patients often struggle with psychiatric
comorbidity [ 5–9]. The results from previous studies in-
dicate that as many as 90% of adult patients with ADHD
struggle with one or more comorbid psychiatric condi-
tions [ 10]. Of these, the most common comorbid condi-
tions are anxiety disorders, affective disorders, substance
abuse, antisocial personality disorders, and developmen-
tal disorders, such as autism and learning difficulties.
ADHD among adults is also associated with impaired
function in areas that include psychosocial functioning,
education, work [ 11,12], and executive function [ 1,13].
There are minimal differences between genders in terms
of symptoms, comorbidities, and function in adults with
ADHD [ 8,14,15].
Previous studies [ 16,17]a n dt h e “Consensus of the
European Network of Adult ADHD ”[18] have pointed out
the importance of psychoeducation as an intervention in
the treatment of adults with ADHD. These recommenda-
tions suggest that psychoeducation could offer understand-
ing of previous difficulties and improve general
functioning. Psychoeducation is not directly process-ori-
ented, but it is effective as a therapeutic intervention for bi-
polar disorder [ 19,20]. The results indicate higher levels of
treatment compliance, better psychosocial functioning, and
improved overall outcomes. Similar results have also been
reported among patients with psychosis: a documented re-
duction of readmissions to hospital, increased compliance,
a n di m p r o v e dq u a l i t yo fl i f e[ 21,22].
We searched PubMed and PsycINFO and found only
one randomized controlled pilot study of psychoeducation
for ADHD among adults. In this study [ 23], a series of 11
psychoeducational sessions related to clear ADHD-specific
challenges were compared with cognitive behavioral group
therapy. The results indicate d that both types of treatments
reduced symptom severity and the negative effects of symp-
toms, diminished hyperactivity and impulsiveness, and im-
proved attention and self-esteem. Patients also reported a
decrease in anxiety and depression symptoms; 93.8% of
patients completed the intervention. We also found a
non-controlled, pilot study of psychoeducational groups for
adults with ADHD and their significant others based on el-
ements of CBT, neuropsychology, and results from interdis-
ciplinary ADHD research. The intervention was conducted
at three different clinics in Sweden and comprised 41 pa-
tients and 40 significant other s. The results suggested there
is an increase in knowledge of ADHD, quality of social rela-
tions, and psychological well-being after treatment [ 24].Even though the results of these studies are promising,
more controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy
of psychoeducation for adults with ADHD. Thus, there
is a necessity to evaluate patient satisfaction and the
short-term effects of psychoeducational group interven-
tions in clinical settings. This study protocol describes
an innovative education group intervention where health
personn el and representatives from the ADHD user
organization educate adults with ADHD to improve
self-management. User involvement will occur during
the intervention delivery phase. Representatives from
user organizations will be peer educators co-leading two
sessions. The intervention will be delivered at two cen-
ters, of which the center that has developed the inter-
vention has limited experience with the research
procedures needed to conduct a proper trial. The other
center has no previous experience delivering the inter-
vention. In order to plan a definitive trial, we must in-
vestigate the feasibility of both the research and
intervention procedures, as well as evaluate patient satis-
faction within the context of the intervention. We re-
quire information on how many patients will complete
the intervention with evaluable data, as well as insight
into the feasibility of randomization procedures and esti-
mates of parameters required for sample calculation.
This intervention is based on active participation and
exchange of experiences between the participants. Meas-
uring patient satisfaction is also an important part of
fine-tuning the intervention before a large-scale trial.
Hence, the purpose of our study was to investigate the
feasibility, preliminary effects, and patient satisfaction
with a group-based psychoeducational program consist-
ing of ten sessions delivered to adults with ADHD using
a prospective, randomized, and controlled study design.
Methods
Study design
This protocol describes a multicenter trial to study pa-
tient satisfaction and the preliminary efficacy of a
group-based psychoeducational program for adults with
ADHD and is available online at ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT03337425). The study will be reported in accord-
ance with the Template for Interventions Description
and Replication and the Consolidated Standards of
Reporting Trials.
Patients from two different outpatient clinics
(Nord-Trøndelag Hospital Trust and Tiller District Psy-
chiatric Centre) will be included. The treatment is avail-
able for patients in the Nord-Trøndelag Hospital Trust
for 4 years, but it has not been evaluated nor has it been
implemented at the other center. Therefore, a pilot study
is warranted. All patients included in the study will re-
ceive treatment as usual concomitant to psychoeduca-
tion or waitlist. Patients will be recruited and randomlyVaag et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:17 Page 2 of 7
assigned to condition A, psychoeducation + treatment as
usual, or condition B, waiting list + treatment as usual.
There is a need for at least 30 subjects in each cohort.
Eligible outpatients diagnosed with ADHD at one of the
outpatient clinics could be enrolled. The inclusion and
exclusion criteria are listed in Table 1, and the recruit-
ment procedure and assignment to conditions are found
in Fig. 1.
Condition A: Psychoeducation concomitant with treatment
as usual
Both conditions A and B received treatment as usual (see
description under the “Condition B: Waiting list concomi-
tant with treatment as usual ”section) in addition to
psychoeducation or waitlist. The group-based psychoedu-
cational program consists of ten sessions that were ran
over ten consecutive weeks. Each session consists of a lec-
ture from a recruited expert on the topic of the session
(20 min) with a following discussion of the topic (45 min)
facilitated by the course leader (Table 2). All sessions are
organized and led by the course leader, which also in-
cludes structured time, discussion, and closing of the
session.
Condition B: Waiting list concomitant with treatment as
usual
Treatment as usual consists of treatment with ADHD
medication for most patients. Additionally, certain pa-
tients would normally receive counseling or psychother-
apy, although this is not systematically provided to every
patient; thus, the randomization procedures are neces-
sary to reduce this as a possible bias. If needed, patients
are also offered assistance with regard to economy,
housing, education, and work as well as contact with
family and their network. The participants allocated to
the waiting list control group were told to live as normal
and continue with treatment.
Data and measurement
Clinical symptoms and function will be measured at the
time of recruitment prior to randomization (T0),
pre-intervention (T1), post-intervention (T2) as well as
at 10 weeks follow-up (T3). The waitlist-control group
will have two additional measurements during the pre-
and post-waiting period. Measuring patient satisfaction
and change in symptom load, general self-efficacy, qual-
ity of life, and function can serve as indicators of thepreliminary efficacy of the intervention. The assessments
and measurements are listed in Fig. 2.
Fidelity scale
Fidelity will be assessed with a fidelity scale. The scale
evaluates different components of intervention fidelity,
such as process fidelity, content fidelity, and quality of
interaction. The scale will be completed at ten time
points during the intervention delivery phase.
Medical records
Medical records will be used to collect demographic in-
formation, history of medication, as along with informa-
tion about psychiatric comorbidity. Allowance to use
such data is included in the participants ’informed
consent.
Self-reported demographics and questionnaires
Demographic information about age, sex, education, use
of healthcare services, and employment status is collected
at baseline and T1 with a self-report questionnaire.
Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8)
A modified version of the Client Satisfaction Ques-
tionnaire (CSQ-8) [ 25]i si n c l u d e di no r d e rt oa s s e s s
satisfaction in relation to the group-based psychoedu-
cational program. The scale consists of eight items
measured on a scale from 1 to 4; three of the items
are reverse scored. A sum score between 8 and 32 in-
dicates the level of satisfaction with the services pro-
vided. The modification of the questionnaire is an
additional open question, where the participants may
comment on the content and suggest changes to the
psychoeducational program.
General Self-Efficacy Scale 6-Item (GSE-6)
The GSE-6 is a short-form version of the GSE scale
[26]. It will be employed to measure general
self-efficacy [ 27]. Self-efficacy is regarded as a protect-
ive factor in adapting to stre ss and chronic illness. It
refers to the belief that one would be able to control
and adapt to challenging demands in the future. The
scale consists of six items measured on a 4-point
scale from “n o ta ta l lt r u e ”(1) to “exactly true ”(4).
T h ep o s s i b l es c o r er a n g ei s6 –24 with a high score
reflecting a higher level of self-efficacy.
Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale Full Edition (ASRS)
The ASRS is the World Health Organizations self-
reporting scale for ADHD in adults [ 28]. The scale is de-
signed to examine the current ADHD symptomatology
and consists of 18 items based on the DSM-V diag-
nostic criteria for ADHD. The scale is divided into
two parts, and each has a sum score. Questions 1 –9Table 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

(part A) reflect symptoms of inattention (I), and
questions 10 –18 (part B) reflect symptoms of impul-
sivity and hyperactivity (HI).
Hopkin ’s Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) 9-item
The SCL-90 is a self-report scale for measuring psy-
chiatric symptoms. An ADHD-specific scale consisting
of nine items from the original 90 (SCL-9) has been
tested and validated for screening. This shows accept-
able sensitivity with regard to measuring ADHD
symptoms and is a supplement to ASRS. The SCL-9
covers the specific characteristic traits of ADHD with
high scores on SCL-9 indicating ADHD-related symp-
tom burden [ 29].AAQoL —health-related quality of life
The AAQoL is a measure of health-related quality of life
(HRQoL) that investigates quality of life and function
among adults with ADHD. The AAQoL consists of 29
questions measuring HRQoL over the previous 2 weeks.
The original version of the AAQoL has exhibited
satisfactory psychometric properties in previous studies
[30–32]. The Norwegian version has previously been val-
idated by our research group and was found to fit well
with the original version [ 33].
Statistics
Statistical analysis will be conducted using SPSS [ 34]
and STATA [ 35]. In order to calculate preliminary ef-
fects, chi-square statistics and ttests will be used forFig. 1 Recruitment procedure and assignment to conditions

descriptive analyses of categorical and continuous vari-
ables, respectively, in addition to analysis of variance
(ANOVA) for comparison of results for the control and
experimental groups. Possible other predictors for the pre-
liminary efficacy of psychoeducation will be examined
using linear regression on the total sample (pre-post inter-
vention). Intervention adherence will be calculated by
assessing the response rate of participants receiving the
intervention, response rate of returned questionnaires,
and the number of sessions completed by intervention
group participants. Recruitment and dropout rates will be
evaluated using absolute and percentage frequencies.
Sample size
This project is intended to evaluate the feasibility of
implementing an educational group intervention led in
co-operation with health personnel and peer educators
to inform an eventual larger-scale randomized study that
will allow for a more rigorous assessment of the impact
of the intervention. Hence, our sample size is drivenprimarily by practical issues related to the number of pa-
tients needed to enroll at each site, opinions about the
questionnaires, and satisfaction with the intervention.
Consequently, the anticipated sample will be 60 pa-
tients —30 patients in each arm. The chosen sample size
is also in accordance with the median number of partici-
pants observed in an audit of pilot and feasibility trials
in the UK [ 36].
Ethics
The project is registered and approved by the Regional
Committees for Medical Research Ethics (REC 2016/
1885) and will be conducted in accordance with the eth-
ical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013).
User involvement
User involvement will be by advisory participation by
one peer educator from the ADHD user organization
with experience cooperating with mental health services.
The advisory participation will occur during protocolFig. 2 Content for the schedule of enrolment, interventions, and assessmentsVaag et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:17 Page 5 of 7
preparation to ensure that all relevant outcomes are in-
cluded. User involvement will also be determined during
the intervention delivery phase. Peer educators will be
co-led via two sessions.
Discussion
This study protocol presents a pilot randomized,
waitlist-controlled, multicenter trial of a psychoeduca-
tional group intervention for patients with ADHD.
ADHD is a disorder with high prevalence rates associ-
ated with impaired psychosocial functioning, education,
and work. Patients may therefore require education and
support to cope with these conditions during everyday
life. However, the effectiveness of such programs imple-
mented in outpatient clinics remains unclear. This pilot
study will assess the preliminary efficacy of the interven-
tion on ADHD-related symptoms (ASRS and SCL-9),
ADHD-related quality of life, function, and employment
status as well as patient satisfaction with intervention
content. If the program is beneficial for the patients and
feasible for the clinics, then it may be implemented in
other clinics. The results would also add to the prelimin-
ary empirical evidence needed to inform the develop-
ment of larger and more complex studies.
Main study and decision to proceed
The pilot study utilizes the same design as the intended
main study to make a proper decision on whether to
proceed or not. The decision to proceed will be based
on the measurement of client satisfaction as well as the
preliminary efficacy of ADHD-related symptoms and
quality of life. With this, our study may influence the
clinical practice and short-term results to empower pa-
tients in the management of their own symptoms and
health treatment. The short-time impact of the interven-
tion on function is unclear. If the decision is to proceed,
then the long-term effects of the intervention will be
assessed in a new main study employing the same design
but with an additional 3 or 6 months of follow-up.
Methodological strengths
To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first pilot
randomized, waitlist-controlled, multicenter trial of a
psychoeducational intervention for patients with adult
ADHD. All participants will be recruited from outpatient
clinics. These are patients with a confirmed diagnosis.
The treatment is delivered in outpatient clinics and will
therefore increase the ecological validity of the study
within a Norwegian health care context. The outcome
measurements will be based on validated instruments
and well-tested in international research as well as in
clinical practice. This offers useful data both for research
and the clinic. Translated instruments are validated and
published in international peer-reviewed journals. Weused a multicenter intervention and different course
leaders and lecturers to reduce the effect of individual
therapeutic factors. This offers more reliable evidence
on the specific effects of the intervention content.
Methodological weaknesses
This study is not double-blinded nor did we use the
“placebo intervention ”other than the waiting list owing
to ethical considerations. We do not compare our model
to another form of treatment other than treatment as
usual, but this is because there is a lack of a gold stand-
ard for psychoeducational interventions in adult ADHD.
The waiting list group design has certain weaknesses,
but considering the ethical aspects requiring that all pa-
tients receive treatment, the interventions were import-
ant (waiting lists are typical in these clinics).
Conclusion
This study protocol presents a pilot randomized, con-
trolled trial that will evaluate an innovative education
program for patients with ADHD. It aims to enhance
self-management behaviors. The results will be of inter-
est to health care professionals working with ADHD pa-
tients. Additionally, our study will be of value to user
organizations and policy makers administering educa-
tional programs with respect to the agenda of prevention
and treatment of ADHD in adulthood.
