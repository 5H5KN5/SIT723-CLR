Abstract
Introduction: Active play is a novel approach to addressing low physical activity levels and fundamental movement
skills (FMS) in childhood and new interventions must be developed and evaluated.
Aim: This study aimed to determine the feasibility of a 10-week school-based ‘active play ’intervention, and present
preliminary findings on four outcomes: physical activity levels, FMS, inhibition, and maths fluency.
Methods: This was a feasibility cluster RCT in which eight schools (one primary three class per school) were paired and
randomly allocated to either the 10-week intervention ( n= 4) or waiting-list control ( n= 4). The active play intervention
consisted of a 1-h outdoor physical activity session per week, incorporating 30 min of facilitated games and 30 min of
free play. Feasibility measures were gathered using appropriate methods and physical activity was measured using an
ActiGraph GT3X accelerometer, FMS were assessed using the Test of Gross Motor Development-2 (TGMD-2), inhibition
was measured using a Flanker Test and maths fluency was assessed using the One Minute Basic Number Facts Test.
Results: Sixty-six percent of eligible children ( n= 137) agreed to participate in the research. No schools withdrew from
the study and three participants were lost to follow-up. Compliance to the intervention was high —none of
the participants missed more than two of the ten schedu led active play sessions. Data lost to follow-up were
minimal; most were lost (14%) for school day physical activity. Active play sessions were shorter than planned
on average by 10 min, and participants spent a mean of 39.4% (14.2) of the session time in moderate-to-vigorous
intensity physical activity (MVPA). There was preliminary evidence of a small intervention effect on MVPA ( d= 0.3), FMS
score ( d= 0.4), inhibition (fish trial: d= 0.1, arrow trial d= 0.1) and maths fluency (addition: d=0 . 3 ,s u b t r a c t i o n : d=0 . 1 ) .
Conclusion: The active play intervention was feasible and benefitted from a relatively high MVPA content; however,
preliminary findings suggest the intervention had a small effect on the outcomes. Having more active play sessions per
week and/or extending the duration of the interve ntion may increase the effects and these should be
tested before a future definitive cluster RCT is undertaken.
Trial registration: This trial was registered on the International Standardised Randomised Controlled Trials
Number register (ISRCTN) in August 2017 ( ISRCTN11607781 ).

Introduction
It is recommended that UK school-aged children and
adolescents (5 –18 years) should engage in at least
60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
(MVPA) per day [ 1]. In Canada, new ‘24-hour move-
ment guidelines ’encourage a whole day approach to
movement by recommending that children should en-
gage in four behaviours: ‘sweating, stepping, sleeping
and sitting ’, at optimal levels to gain the associated
health benefits [ 2]. Specifically, for primary school-age
children, a healthy 24 h would include 9 –11 h of sleep,
60 min of MVPA, several hours of structured and un-
structured physical activity, screen time use of no more
than 2 h and a limited amount of time spent sitting [ 2].
Achieving the UK or Canadian guidelines should bring
health benefits, including reducing the risk of some can-
cers, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity,
mental wellbeing and poor bone health [ 2–4]. However,
children in Scotland and in other high-income countries
are typically not achieving the recommended 60 min of
MVPA per day [ 5,6].
Recent systematic reviews into the contribution of ac-
tive commuting to school, recess and physical education
(PE) on children ’s physical activity levels have suggested
that they make a small contribution to helping children
achieve the physical activity guidelines [ 7–9]. A recent
systematic review found that interventions to promote
active play have received little attention in physical activ-
ity research to date [ 10], but the potential of active play
for increasing physical activity levels may be substantial
given that it can be engaged in before, during and after
school, 365 days of the year [ 11]. Active play is ‘a form
of gross motor or total body movement in which young
children exert energy in a freely chosen, fun and un-
structured manner ’[12]. It is often engaged in outdoors,
which is associated with higher habitual physical activity
and MVPA levels and is suggested to be one of the fac-
tors explaining the higher levels of physical activity in
low–middle-income countries compared to high-income
countries [ 6,13–15]. Furthermore, in high-income coun-
tries, those from a lower socio-economic status (SES)
typically engage in less active play than those from a
higher SES [ 16,17].
In addition to increasing physical activity levels, active
play also has the potential to improve fundamental
movement skills (FMS) [ 18–20]. FMS are a set of skills,
which children should be competent in (such as throw-
ing catching, running and jumping) and competency in
these skills is associated with higher physical activity
levels [ 21–23]. Furthermore, research has suggested a
possible link between MVPA and improved executive
function (i.e. inhibition) and maths attainment [ 24]. In-
hibition is the ability to suppress actions and modify be-
haviour, which is implicated in many areas of life andlearning. Active play has been suggested as a potentially
good way of achieving both increased MVPA and im-
proved inhibition [ 25,26].
The UK MRC Framework for complex interventions
recommends feasibility and pilot research before a de-
finitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) is undertaken
[27]. The authors of the present study conducted a prag-
matic evaluation of the active play intervention (formally
known as Go2Play Active Play) on physical activity and
FMS in a non-randomised group of participants [ 18].
This pragmatic evaluation was sufficiently promising to
develop the intervention and evaluation in the form of
the present study.
Therefore, the aim of this cluster RCT was to deter-
mine the feasibility of an active play intervention to in-
form a future definitive RCT. Information on consent
rate, data lost to follow-up, intervention fidelity and esti-
mates of the effect for each outcome measure (physical
activity, fundamental movement skills, inhibition and
maths fluency) was collected.
Methodology
Trial design
The present study was a two-arm parallel feasibility clus-
ter RCT involving eight primary schools (one primary
three class per school) located in Glasgow, Scotland.
Glasgow City Council and the funders of the interven-
tion (Inspiring Scotland) chose pupils in primary 3 (aged
7 years) to receive the intervention because this age
group receive the least amount of additional physical ac-
tivity opportunities compared to other age groups.
Schools were paired based on relevant criteria and then
randomly assigned either to the intervention group or
waiting-list control (described in more detail below).
Baseline data were collected in August and September
2017 and follow-up data were collected in November
and December 2017.
This trial was registered on the International Standar-
dised Randomised Controlled Trials Number register
(ISRCTN) in August 2017 (ISRCTN11607781) and fol-
lows the CONSORT guidelines for reporting pilot and
feasibility trials [ 28].
Ethical approval was granted by Glasgow City Coun-
cil’s Education Services and the University of Strath-
clyde ’s School of Psychological Sciences and Health
Ethics Committee prior to data collection.
Procedures
In April 2017, Glasgow City Council invited 32 schools
from the South and 28 schools from the North West of
Glasgow to participate in the Active Play intervention
during the 2017 –2018 school year. Thirty-four of the 60
schools agreed to participate in the intervention, and a
list of these schools was sent to the lead researcher whoJohnstone et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:45 Page 2 of 13
divided the schools by location (South and North West).
A profile of each school was created by obtaining infor-
mation held by the Scottish Government ( www.gov.scot/
Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/Datasets )o n
socio-economic status (SES) of the school as measured
by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD)
score, percentage of children on free school meals, per-
centage of children who live in the 20% most deprived
areas, school enrolment, number of primary 3 children,
percentage of children from ethnic minority groups and
if the schools had an existing relationship with the char-
ities delivering the active play intervention.
The aim of the funders, Inspiring Scotland, was to im-
plement the active play intervention in the most de-
prived schools in Glasgow; for this reason, schools were
eligible for this study if at least 70% of pupils from the
school were living in the 20% most deprived areas of
Scotland. Schools ( n= 3) were also excluded if they had
an existing relationship with any of the charities that de-
livered the active play intervention (to avoid contamin-
ation) or had been involved in the previous pragmatic
evaluation [ 18]. Once the schools not meeting these cri-
teria were excluded, five schools remained from the
South of the city and six schools from the North West,
at which point they were paired on deprivation (based
on the percentage of children who live in the 20% most
deprived areas), school enrolment, demographics (per-
centage of children from ethnic minorities) and geog-
raphy (located close to each other). Two schools in the
North West and one school in the South of the city were
removed and kept for contingencies because they were
not located near the other schools. Therefore, eight
schools were selected for the study and all of these eight
schools agreed to take part in the study via their head
teachers.
Each pair of schools were randomised prior to data
collection beginning. A researcher unaffiliated to the
present study used a random number generator to ran-
domly assign each pair to either the intervention or the
waiting-list control. Schools allocated to the intervention
group were informed they would receive the interven-
tion starting in August 2017 and the control schools
would receive the intervention in April 2018 once the
research was completed. Eight schools were involved in
the study due to limitations on time and resources; this
was considered sufficient for a feasibility trial as previous
studies have also used a similar number of clusters [ 29].
Information and consent forms were distributed to all
children in the primary 3 class of each school. Children
were asked to pass on the consents to their primary care
giver, who then provided consent (by signing the consent
form and returning it to the teacher in the child ’s school
bag) if they wished their child to participate in the re-
search. The class teacher then gathered the consents forthe researcher who collected them in early August 2017.
Children orally confirmed that they would like to partici-
pate in the research and were reminded that they could
opt out of the research without affecting their participa-
tion in the active play intervention. All children partici-
pated in the active play intervention, but only
consenting children participated in the study. Partici-
pants were eligible for the study if they were apparently
healthy and able to participate in active play unaided.
Participants ’weight status, SES using the SIMD [ 30],
FMS, inhibition and maths fluency measured 2 weeks
before the intervention began, and physical activity was
measured 1 week before the intervention began. At week
9 of the intervention, physical activity was measured
again, and the other outcome measures were assessed
once the intervention was completed.
Intervention
Inspiring Scotland ( www.inspiringscotland.org.uk ,
Edinburgh) and Agile CIC ( www.agilecic.com ,G l a s -
gow) developed the active play (formally known as
Go2Play Active Play) intervention in 2014. In the
present study, the intervention was delivered by play-
workers from two local play charities who were
trained by Agile CIC. The intervention has been de-
tailed previously [ 18], but briefly, it is underpinned by
the concept of physical literacy. Physical literacy is
‘the motivation, confidence, physical competence,
knowledge and understanding to value and take re-
sponsibility for engagement in physical activities for
life’[31].Key to establishing a foundation of good
physical literacy is developing children ’s physical com-
petency (i.e. FMS) and ensuring they have a positive
experience of physical activity from an early age [ 32–
34]. Increasing levels of MVPA and improving funda-
mental movement skills are the main aims of the
present intervention.
The active play intervention was delivered to one pri-
mary 3 class per school for 10 weeks (one session per
week). The intervention was planned to consist of a 1-h
outdoor physical activity session: 30 min of facilitated
games plus 30 min of free play. The play charities were
supplied with a standard set of basic equipment, which
included a range of balls, tennis racquets, hockey sticks,
skipping ropes among other items to enable them to de-
liver both elements of the intervention. This equipment
was not left with schools to use between sessions. Dur-
ing the facilitated section of the session, the playworkers
led and joined in on games designed to develop partici-
pants ’FMS and other components of physical literacy
(examples of games can be found at www.actify.org.uk/
activeplay ). During the free play section of the session,
the equipment was provided, and participants were free
to choose what they wanted to play. The playworkersJohnstone et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:45 Page 3 of 13
and teachers were encouraged to participate fully in the
sessions with the children. The delivery principles of the
active play sessions are that they should be fun, inclusive
and active, which should encourage high levels of MVPA
and FMS development [ 18].
Although children only received one session per week,
the intervention might increase physical activity levels be-
yond the session as the equipment is basic, inexpensive
and readily available at home or school; children are learn-
ing to play which may encourage play outside intervention
time; and improving FMS and other aspects of physical lit-
eracy might facilitate increased physical activity [ 22,23].
Outcomes
Anthropometrics
All consenting participants had their height and weight
measured at baseline only (to the nearest 0.1 cm/kg)
using a portable stadiometer and digital scales (both
Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Weight status is presented as
a BMI z-score relative to 1990 UK reference data;
healthy weight (BMI z-score < 1.04); overweight (BMI
z-score 1.04 –1.64); and obese (BMI z-score > 1.64).
Feasibility measures
The total number of children in each class was provided
by the class teacher. From this, the percentage of chil-
dren who consented from the total sample available was
calculated by the lead researcher.
Feasibility of the outcome measures was also captured
by the lead researcher who kept a record of the number
of children who provided data at baseline for each out-
come measure, and the number, with explanations, that
were lost to follow-up (for example, moved school, no
longer wanted to participate in research, data not valid).
To determine if the intervention was delivered as
intended, the playworkers kept a record of the number of
sessions they delivered, if any sessions were delivered in-
doors due to adverse weather conditions, how long the
sessions lasted and if any child was injured because of par-
ticipating in active play. Additionally, the lead researcher
observed the playworkers delivering one session per
school at week 4 or 6 of the intervention to determine if
they were delivered as intended. To support observations,
an assessment tool was developed by Agile CIC, which
assessed four key dimensions to delivering a successful
session: team/individual skills and attributes (for example,
demonstrates confidence and enthusiasm), knowledge and
experience (for example, demonstrates experience in lead-
ing play and physical activity sessions), putting the training
into practice (for example, plans and delivers appropriate
session for age group) and delivery (for example, session
incorporates a range of FMS and are fun, inclusive and ac-
tive). For each of these four dimensions, there were 4 –6
items in which the playworkers were scored out of 5. Classteachers were asked to record attendance at the active play
sessions to determine how many sessions each participant
attended.
School day physical activity
Physical activity was measured using an ActiGraph
GT3X accelerometer (Pensacola, Florida, USA), which is
a small and unobtrusive monitor attached to an elastic
waist-belt worn over the participant ’s right hip [ 35–37].
Data were collected in 15-s epochs and raw physical ac-
tivity data were converted to total volume of physical ac-
tivity (counts per minute —cpm) and time (minutes/
school day) spent in sedentary (0 –100 cpm), light (101 –
2292 cpm) and MVPA ( ≥2293 cpm) intensities using
Evenson cut points [ 35]. Evenson cut points have evi-
dence of validity and reliability for children and adoles-
cents across varying physical activity intensities [ 35,38].
Participants were asked to wear the ActiGraph acceler-
ometer for five school days (9.00 –15.00), except for one
pair of schools who wore the monitors for four school
days. Teachers helped the children attach the accelerom-
eters. Each child was assigned a specific monitor (de-
noted by a number displayed on the monitor) and a list
of each child and their specific monitor was noted in a
handbook supplied to each class teacher involved in the
research to ensure each child wore the same device each
day. Class teachers reported the time the monitors were
attached and removed each day in their handbook, and
these times were used to extract the raw data from the
monitors. Participants had to wear the monitors for a
minimum of four school hours and for at least 3 days
for the data to be valid, the same criteria used in our
previous study and in other school-based studies [ 18,
39]. The average actual wear time during school-time
was 5.4 h per day and 4.5 days at baseline and 5.3 h per
day and 4.3 days at follow-up.
Each pair of schools had their physical activity mea-
sured during the same week at baseline and follow-up
and were measured the week prior to the intervention
beginning at baseline and during week 9 of the interven-
tion for follow-up. However, one intervention school
was measured at week 8 of the intervention as their first
session was cancelled and two control schools had to be
measured again in January 2018, as they did not wear
the monitors during week 9 (i.e. November and Decem-
ber 2017) as planned.
Physical activity content of active play
During the follow-up physical activity data collection
week which took place on week 8 ( n= 1 school) or 9 ( n
= 3 schools) of the intervention, the lead researcher
attended the intervention sessions to note the time (to
the nearest minute) the session started, finished and
when the facilitated games part finished, and free playJohnstone et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:45 Page 4 of 13
began. These times were then used to accurately extract
accelerometer data to determine the physical activity
content of the sessions in terms of percent time spent in
sedentary behavior, light intensity physical activity and
MVPA.
Fundamental movement skills
FMS were assessed using the Test of Gross Motor
Development-2 (TGMD-2), which is divided into two
subtests: locomotor (run, gallop, hop, leap, horizontal
jump, sidestep) and object control (strike, dribble, catch,
kick, throw, underhand roll) [ 40]. Each skill is comprised
of 3–5 components based on a model performance of
how the skill should be performed. If the participant per-
formed each component as described, they were scored
a‘1’,o ra ‘0’if they did not [ 40].
FMS were assessed, predominately outdoors, by the
same lead researcher prior to the intervention beginning
and after the intervention had finished. During the assess-
ment, the lead researcher demonstrated the skill once and
then participants performed each skill twice while being
observed and scored accordingly [ 40]. Scores were then
adjusted for age and gender to give standard scores and
percentiles for the locomotor and object control skills,
which are then totalled to give a gross motor quotient
score (GMQ —total FMS score) and a percentile [ 40].
In instances where more than 20 children consented
from a school ( n= 1 school), 10 male and 10 female par-
ticipants were randomly selected using a random num-
ber generator to have their FMS assessed due to time
restrictions.
Inhibition
Inhibition was measured using the NIH Toolbox Flanker
Test, which was administered on an Apple iPad Air 2
(Apple Inc., California, USA). The Flanker Test con-
sisted of a mix of congruent (all stimuli facing in the
same direction) and incongruent trials (the middle
stimulus is facing in the opposite direction to the flanker
stimuli) and participants were asked to select the button
on the screen that matched the direction of the middle
stimulus [ 41]. Participants were given four practice trials
and if they got > 1 one trial incorrect, they received a
further four practice trials. The test consisted of 20 trials
where the stimuli were fish and if they scored 18/20 cor-
rect, they then completed another test involving 20 trials
where arrows were the stimuli (12 congruent and 8 in-
congruent trials for both tests) [ 41]. Participants were
given a maximum of 10 s to respond in each trial; if they
did not respond within this timeframe, then the screen
moved on to the next trial.
Practice and non-response trials were removed, and
accuracy scores were calculated for the fish test and the
arrow test separately (average accuracy score). Trialswith incorrect responses were then removed and reac-
tion time (s) was averaged for the fish test and the arrow
test separately for the congruent and incongruent trials.
Finally, the mean reaction time for the congruent trials
was subtracted from the mean reaction time for the in-
congruent trials for the fish test and the arrow test sep-
arately to calculate the conflict score (i.e. the measure of
inhibition) for the fish test and the arrow test for each
participant.
Maths fluency
Maths fluency was measured using the One Minute
Basic Number Facts Test (1995), which was a simple
pencil and paper test that assessed participants ’
addition and subtraction abilities [ 42]. Participants
were asked to answer as many addition sums as pos-
sible in 1 min by writing their answers next to sums
[42]. The same protocol was then followed for the
subtraction element of the test [ 42]. The number of
correct answers was then totalled separately for the
addition and subtraction component of the test [ 42].
Normative values recommend that a child aged 7 years
old should be scoring 8 points for addition and 6.5
points for subtraction.
Inhibition and maths fluency were measured 2 weeks
prior to the intervention beginning and again at
follow-up once the intervention was complete. Partici-
pants were assessed in small groups in a quiet room sup-
plied by each school and the order of assessments
conducted was randomised to minimise order effects;
for example, if one group completed the inhibition
measure first, the following group completed the maths
fluency first. The same protocol was followed in most
instances at follow-up; however, at the start of baseline
data collection, there was a delay in obtaining the NIH
Toolbox Flanker Test, which resulted in the researchers
arranging to go back and measure schools ( n=3 ) o n a
separate day. We did not measure inhibition on a separ-
ate day for follow-up in these three schools.
Blinding
Standardised procedures were followed for each out-
come measured at baseline and follow-up. The lead re-
searcher was not blinded to any of the outcome
measures; however, the lead researcher could not influ-
ence the physical activity, inhibition and maths fluency
measures. For the FMS outcome, the same researcher
assessed each participant at both baseline and follow-up
following standardised procedures.
Data analysis
Data analyses were completed using SPSS v 23.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL). Initial tests for normality were con-
ducted to determine if data were normally distributedJohnstone et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:45 Page 5 of 13
(skewness and kurtosis < |2.0|). To explore the potential
effect of the intervention, preliminary analyses were con-
ducted to obtain the mean change and 95% CIs for the
change in each outcome from baseline to follow-up
within each group and between groups (i.e. the mean
difference between the groups for the change and the
95% CI) and effect sizes were calculated using Cohen ’sd;
d> 0.2 is a small effect size, d> 0.5 is medium and d>
0.8 is a large effect size. Since inhibition was not nor-
mally distributed, the median change from baseline to
follow-up within each group and between groups (i.e.
the mean difference between the groups for the change
and the 95% CI) was obtained and effect sizes were cal-
culated using Cohen ’sd. The statistical analysis was
completed by the lead author and supported by an expe-
rienced statistician.Results
Baseline characteristics
Figure 1shows the flow of schools and participants
through the study. As Fig. 1highlights, a total of 207
children from the primary 3 class of each school were
invited to take part in the research (2 participants were
not eligible as they had a disability which may have af-
fected their ability to engage in active play). A total of
137 children (intervention n= 73; control n= 64) con-
sented to participate in the study, a consent rate of 66%.
The consent rate varied across schools and was margin-
ally higher in the intervention group (68%; school 1 =
65%, school 2 = 73%, school 3 = 90%, school 4 = 43%)
compared to the control (64%; school 5 = 61%, school 6
= 73%, school 7 = 59%, school 8 = 63%). Baseline charac-
teristics of the consenting participants were similar in

Feasibility outcomes
Figure 1shows that no schools were lost to follow-up
and three children moved from their schools during the
study period ( n= 2 from the intervention group and n
= 1 from the control group). The number of partici-
pants providing data for each outcome at baseline and
lost to follow-up is also presented in Fig. 1.D a t al o s tt o
follow-up were minimal in most instances, and when
data were lost to follow-up, this was predominantly due
to pupil absences on measurement days for each of the
outcomes. Most data were lost (14%; n=3f o rt h ei n t e r -
vention group and n= 16 for the control group) for the
school day physical activity outcome, which was largely
due to participants not wearing the monitor for the
minimum wear time as specified in the Methods sec-
tion. Physical activity was measured at baseline during
August and September and f ollow-up during November
and December; however, physical activity had to be
re-measured in two control schools during January
2018, as they did not wear the monitors during week 9
as planned.
All schools received 10 weeks of the intervention;
however, one school had a session cancelled during week
1, which meant (as previously stated) physical activity
measurements were taken at week 8 and this school re-
ceived two sessions during the final week. One school
purchased the services of one play charity to provide
more active play opportunities throughout their school
during the research period, which involved a combin-
ation of recess games and play leadership on 1 day of
the week. The primary 3 class from this control school
did not receive any play leadership but might have en-
gaged in activities during recess on the day the play
charity provided activities.
Attendance at the active play sessions was high, only
four participants missed two sessions and no partici-
pants missed more than two sessions. All sessions took
place outdoors but tended to be shorter than the 1 h, by10 min on average, due to class teachers bringing the
participants to the sessions late because they had to walk
from their class to where the session was being delivered
in the playground.
Playworkers from both play charities scored highly in
the assessment tool, with play charity A scoring 3.6 and
play charity B scoring 4.7 out of 5. The main area where
playworkers needed to improve was in the delivery as-
pect of the assessment tool. The sessions would have
been further enhanced if the playworkers increased their
confidence through expanding their knowledge of the
intervention and greater practice of facilitating the ses-
sions. See Table 2for each charity ’s score on the assess-
ment tool.

Discussion
The present study was a feasibility cluster RCT designed
to inform a future definitive cluster RCT; therefore, the
sample size was not designed to detect interventionTable 3 Percent of school day spent in sedentary behaviour, light intensity physical activity, and MVPA at baseline and follow-up in

effects. Information collected on the feasibility out-
comes suggested that the present study is feasible.
The study benefitted from a relatively high pupil con-
sent rate of 66%, a 100% school retention rate and
t h el o s so fo n l yt h r e ep u p i l s( a st h e ym o v e ds c h o o l )
at follow-up. Compliance to the intervention was
high, only four participants from the intervention
group missed two sessions and none missed more
than two. Compliance to the outcome measures was
also high; 14% ( n= 3 for the intervention group and
n= 16 for the control group) of data were lost for the
school day physical activity outcome, which was pre-
dominantly due to participants not wearing the moni-
tor for the minimum wear time as specified in the
‘Methods ’section. Furthermore, two control schools
had physical activity re-measured in January 2018.
The playworkers who implemented the intervention
scored highly in the assessment tool, but confidence
could have been higher in the delivery of sessions.
Furthermore, the sessions were often shorter than
intended by approximately 10-min per session, which
equates to a total of 1-h and 40 min over the
10 weeks. Sessions were shorter because teachers
brought the children late to the sessions, particularly
when an active play session followed afternoon recess.
The low levels of participants lost to follow-up, data
lost to follow-up and high compliance to theintervention might be partly explained by the benefits
of delivering the intervention and collecting outcome
data in a school setting.
The present study had a consent rate of 66% which
was reasonable in comparison to other similar studies;
a non-school-based active play intervention conducted
by O ’Dwyer et al. [ 43] had a consent rate of 42%.
Participant dropout rate was comparatively lower in
t h ep r e s e n ts t u d yt h a no t h e rs t u d i e s ,w i t ho n l yt h r e e
participants dropping out as they moved school dur-
ing the course of the study [ 44]. Data lost at
follow-up varied across the outcomes, but most was
lost (14%) for the physical activity outcome, which
was marginally higher than similar studies [ 19,44]. In
a future definitive trial, the timings of the measure-
m e n t ss h o u l db ec o n s i d e r e da st w os c h o o l so r i g i n a l l y
scheduled to have their follow-up physical activity
had to be re-measured in January. This is because
December is often a busy period for schools, and
therefore it might not be suitable to measure physical
activity during this month in Scottish schools. Partici-
pants appeared to be receptive to the active play
intervention with only four participants missing two
sessions and none missed more than two. In sum-
mary, the procedures for conducting the present
feasibility RCT appear to be mostly suitable for a fu-
ture definitive trial.Table 5 Fundamental movement skills scores at baseline and follow-up in the intervention and control group

The active play intervention benefits from a collab-
orative approach in which local play charities deliver
the sessions to enable teachers to participate, learn
and then embed the intervention beyond the 10 weeks.
Furthermore, utilising charities who are experts in
play might increase the li kelihood that children will
continue playing at home and in their communities,
particularly as the equipment provided is likely to be
similar to what children might have access to at
home.
The active play intervention was promising in terms of
the MVPA content, with participants spending on aver-
age 39.4% of the session in MVPA. Interestingly, the par-
ticipants engaged in slightly more MVPA during the free
play component of the session compared to the facili-
tated games component (41.3% of time in MVPA on
average versus 37.6%). The previous study conducted by
Johnstone et al. [ 18] found that the participants spent
30.1% of their time during an active play session in
MVPA and Brazendale et al. found that during a 1-h ses-
sion of solely free play, participants spent 25% of that
time in MVPA [ 45]. To put this in context, a recent sys-
tematic review suggested that during physical education,
participants of primary school-age children typically
spend as little as 11% of their time in MVPA, despite the
recommendation that 50% of time in PE should be
MVPA [ 7,46].
Preliminary findings of the outcome measures from
the present study suggested that the intervention may
have had a small to medium effect on physical activity
levels, FMS inhibition and maths fluency. It should be
noted that for all outcome measures, these findings are
preliminary. This study was not sufficiently powered to
demonstrate significant intervention effects but to help
power a future definitive cluster RCT as noted above.
The preliminary analyses were conducted largely to in-
form a future power calculation.
This present study follows on from a pragmatic evalu-
ation of the ‘Go2Play Active Play ’intervention con-
ducted by the authors of the present study [ 18]. Our
previous study was a pragmatic evaluation (with a
non-randomised small comparison group) of the inter-
vention which lasted 5 months and involved two ses-
sions per week [ 18]. The intervention tested in the
present study used the same format (i.e. 30 min of facili-
tated games and 30 min of free play); however, thefrequency of the sessions and the duration of the inter-
vention were reduced to 10 weeks, one session per week
so that it could be delivered to a larger number of
schools. The previous evaluation of the active play inter-
vention found a 16% increase in light intensity physical
activity and a 3% increase in MVPA in the intervention
group during an average school day [ 18]. However, in
the present study, light intensity physical activity only in-
creased by 0.7% in the intervention group and by 1.7%
in the control group during an average school day. Per-
cent time spent in MVPA increased by 1.4% (4.2 min) in
the intervention group and by 0.6% (1.7 min) for the
control group during an average school day. Given the
low levels of MVPA in the intervention group at baseline
(8.8% of the school day) in the present study, there
should be scope to increase MVPA levels during school
hours. The decision to reduce the intervention to
10 weeks was one made by the funders so that the inter-
vention could be delivered to more schools; however,
preliminary findings from the present study highlight
that more sessions per week may be required to have a
more meaningful effect on school day physical activity.
Physical activity is underpinned by competency in
FMS as it has been suggested that children who have a
higher competency in FMS are more likely to be physic-
ally active [ 22,23]. Baseline FMS in the present study
were poor, participants in the intervention group had a
mean GMQ score of 87.7 and 92.0 in the control group;
it is recommended that children should be scoring at
least 100 [ 40]. The effect of the intervention on GMQ
score ( d= 0.4) was small, but the control group had no
increase in their score, whereas the intervention group
had an increase of 3.1 (95% CI 0.9, 5.3). These findings
were similar to those reported by Adamo et al., who
conducted a 6-month preschool intervention aimed at
providing more active and outdoor play opportunities
[20]. They found that the intervention group increased
their GMQ score by 4.2 (95% CI 0.5, 7.9) and the control
group had a small decrease of −1.5 (95% CI −4.82 to
1.77) [ 20]. The previous study conducted by Johnstone
et al. found much larger increases in GMQ Score (+
10.1; 95% CI 7.9, 12.3) for the intervention group and a
small increase in the comparison group (+ 3.6 –1.3 to
8.4), but the participants had lower baseline scores than
the present study and the duration of the intervention
was 5 months.Table 7 Maths fluency: addition and subtraction scores at baseline and follow-up in the intervention and control group

Recent research has suggested a possible link between
MVPA and cognitively engaging activities (i.e. activities
which target FMS) and improved executive function (in-
hibition) and attainment (particularly maths related out-
comes) [ 24,26]. The present study found preliminary
evidence of a limited intervention effect on conflict
scores (the measure of inhibition) for the fish trials ( d=
0.1) or the arrow trials ( d= 0.1). The present study found
no intervention effect on children ’s maths fluency scores.
There was also a small intervention effect on addition
(d= 0.3) and subtraction scores ( d= 0.1). These scores
are likely to have improved through daily maths lessons
over the study period and there might potentially have
been a practice effect.
There is some evidence of the impact of physical activ-
ity interventions on children ’s inhibition and maths
achievement. In the Medical College of Georgia rando-
mised controlled trial, overweight (> 85th percentile)
participants were recruited and assigned to either
low-dose exercise (20 min/day), high-dose exercise
(40 min/day) or a control condition (educational compo-
nent). The exercises focused on fun, inclusion and inten-
sity, and participants wore heart rate monitors to
measure the intensity of physical activity. Executive
functions (planning, attention, etc.) and maths attain-
ment were assessed, and the authors found a
dose-response relationship with planning ( p= 0.015), but
not maths achievement ( p= 0.06). There were no signifi-
cant intervention effects for other executive functions,
but the authors did find significant effects on maths flu-
ency ( p= 0.01).
A study conducted by Donnelly et al. aimed to deter-
mine the effects of a 3-year physical activity interven-
tion, consisting of 90 min of academic active lessons
throughout the school week, on participants ’maths flu-
ency using the WIAT II [ 47]. They found significant im-
provements in maths achievement in the intervention
group compared to the control by approximately seven
points [ 47]. Findings from the Georgia Trial and Don-
nelly et al. suggest that the present active play interven-
tion requires a higher frequency of delivery per week
and/or a longer duration to have a meaningful impact
on cognition and academic attainment. However, the
play intervention sessions in the present study were
characterised by relatively high levels of MVPA and cog-
nitively engaging activities, suggesting improvements in
inhibition and maths fluency might be likely if more ses-
sions were delivered per week. A future study may also
benefit from utilising a more comprehensive method of
assessing maths achievement, such as the WIAT II, ra-
ther than solely maths fluency; although, there are
practical advantages of using a simpler measure. Fur-
thermore, a future study should consider measuring so-
cial and emotional outcomes as these might be otherimportant benefits of the intervention; these factors are
thought to be important mediators for the relationship
between physical activity and cognition [ 48]. Anec-
dotally, teachers have reported that the active play ses-
sions improved friendships among children, improved
happiness and general mental wellbeing.
Study limitations
The present study was a feasibility cluster RCT aimed at
informing a future definitive trial. Although this study
had a high consent rate, low attrition, was well organised
and had a strong design necessary for the development
of a future definitive RCT [ 27], it had some important
weaknesses.
Firstly, the lead researcher who collected most of the
data could not be blinded to group allocation. It is un-
likely that this impacted the physical activity, inhibition
and maths fluency outcomes as the researcher could not
influence these findings; however, there may have been a
bias and/or human error for the FMS scoring. These
were minimised by using a researcher with extensive ex-
perience in using the TGMD-2 and following standar-
dised procedures. Future studies should either blind the
researcher to the intervention and control groups, or
film participants performing the FMS test and score
using the recordings to improve the accuracy of the
scores, which would improve intra- and inter-rater reli-
ability. The school staff could also not be blinded to
group allocation and, therefore, control schools may
have compensated by encouraging more physical activity
during break times or providing additional opportunities
to enhance their math ability.
The schools which agreed to participate in the interven-
tion had low SES, which may have limited the
generalizability of the present study. The aim of the funder
was to provide active play to the most deprived schools in
Glasgow and for this reason, schools were eligible for this
study if 70% or more pupils were from the 20% of Scot-
land’s most deprived areas. However, the majority of the
schools who agreed to participate in the intervention were
deprived and, therefore, schools did not differ with regards
to deprivation. A future definitive RCT of this interven-
tion might consider a wider cross-section of schools.
Finally, due to time and cost, the authors did not include
additional outcomes to determine if there were any unin-
tended intervention effects on participant ’ss o c i a la n d
emotional development. A future definitive trial should
consider additional outcomes (including qualitative mea-
sures) to determine if there are any unintended interven-
tion outcomes.
Conclusions
The present feasibility study provided useful knowledge
about the process and implementation of the interventionJohnstone et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:45 Page 11 of 13
and trial procedures for the proposed definitive trial. The
procedures for collecting the outcome data appear accept-
able; however, further enhancements could be made for
the FMS outcome measure to increase reliability and val-
idity and to measure physical activity over a whole day to
determine if there are intervention effects on physical ac-
tivity outside of school hours. Most changes required for a
definitive trial centre on the intervention itself; results
suggest that a typical active play session generates a high
amount of MVPA, but more than one session per week is
needed to have a meaningful impact on the outcomes
measured. Thought would need to be given on how to im-
plement more active play sessions per week; it might be
that the intervention is delivered twice per week over a 5 –
10-week period initially and then the intervention would
then taper off during school hours and be offered as an
after-school club. This provides a greater opportunity to
offer more sessions per week and to have more influence
over children ’s physical activity levels outside of school
hours. It might also be useful to incorporate a parental
component; these two suggestions should be tested before
a definitive trial takes place.
