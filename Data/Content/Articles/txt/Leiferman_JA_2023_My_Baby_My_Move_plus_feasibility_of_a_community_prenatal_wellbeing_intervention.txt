Abstract 
Background Excessive gestational weight gain (EGWG), insufficient prenatal physical activity and sleep, and poor 
psychological wellbeing independently increase risks for adverse maternal and infant outcomes. A novel approach 
to mitigate these risks is utilizing peer support in a community-based prenatal intervention. This study assessed 
the feasibility (acceptability, demand, implementation, and practicality) of a remotely delivered prenatal physical activ-
ity intervention called My Baby, My Move + (MBMM +) that aims to increase prenatal physical activity, enhance mood 
and sleep hygiene, and reduce EGWG.
Methods Participants were recruited through community organizations, local clinics, and social media platforms 
in the Fall of 2020 and Spring of 2021. Eligible pregnant women were randomized to either the MBMM + interven-
tion or the control group. Each group met over Zoom for 16 sessions (twice weekly for 60 min over 8 weeks) to learn 
either behavioral change and wellbeing knowledge and skills (MBMM +) or knowledge and skills related to parent -
ing (control group). Multiple methods of evaluation to better understand the feasibility of the intervention were 
conducted.
Results A total of 49 women (25 MBMM + intervention, 24 control) completed both pre- and post-survey assess-
ments and were included in the analyses. A subsample of 19 (39%) intervention participants completed a com-
bination of semi-structured interviews/surveys to assess acceptability, demand, implementation, and practicality. 
Participants expressed positive feedback regarding acceptability (satisfaction and intent to continue use) and were 
extremely likely or likely to recommend the program to a friend (demand). Implementation metrics were assessed 
by observation and feedback forms completed by peer leaders and demonstrated high-quality control. Findings sug-
gest that the intervention was practical due to remote sessions and cost-effectiveness.
Conclusion The MBMM + intervention was deemed to be a feasible intervention with high acceptability, demand, 
implementation, and practicality. These findings can be used to inform the scalability of the intervention and imple -
mentation of a larger efficacy trial.
Trial registration 19–1366, initial date is on January 23, 2020.

Key messages regarding feasibility
• The remote delivery platform of MBMM + may influ -
ence components of feasibility (especially practical -
ity).
• MBMM + showed high feasibility across acceptabil -
ity, demand, implementation, and practicality.
• Feasibility findings from this study will inform the 
testing of MBMM + in a larger efficacy trial to bet -
ter understand its impact on indicators of maternal 
health.
Background
The USA has the highest rate of maternal mortality 
among high-income countries [1], and this rate is contin -
uing to increase [2]. Contributors to maternal mortality 
include preventable adverse pregnancy and birth out -
comes that may stem from excessive gestational weight 
gain (EGWG) [3, 4]. Approximately half of pregnant 
women in the USA gain more than the recommended 
weight during pregnancy based on the Institute of Medi -
cine (IOM) guidelines [5]. EGWG increases the risk of 
complications throughout pregnancy such as gestational 
diabetes [6, 7], pre-eclampsia [8], and adverse birth out -
comes including preterm birth [9] and the need for 
cesarean birth [10] and medical induction interventions 
[11]. EGWG also increases the risk of excessive maternal 
weight retention, obesity, and associated chronic diseases 
during the postpartum period and beyond [8, 12–15].
Traditional interventions aimed to reduce EGWG 
have focused primarily on nutrition/dietary changes 
[16–18]. However, results related to sustaining these 
behavior changes into the postpartum period are con -
flicting [13, 17, 19–22]. This may be due in part to the 
variation in health care provider recommendations, as 
well as understanding and compliance with recommen -
dations [23, 24]. A recent review highlights the need to 
identify specific modifiable factors related to gestational 
weight gain to design more effective EGWG interven -
tions [25]. For example, interventions that focus on 
physical activity have shown to be effective in the pre -
vention of EGWG [19, 26, 27] and when physical activ -
ity is combined with dietary changes, there is greater 
potential for healthier outcomes and sustained habits.
Prenatal physical activity is an attractive intervention 
strategy for EGWG as it simultaneously promotes a mul -
titude of maternal health benefits (e.g., reduction in risk of 
gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, depression, and body 
image dysphoria) [28– 30]. Moreover, there is a clear need 
to identify effective strategies to increase prenatal physi -
cal activity as approximately 80% of pregnant women are not meeting recommended guidelines [31– 33]. A combi -
nation of knowledge, skill building, motivation, and stress 
management may increase the likelihood of consistent 
engagement in regular physical activity throughout preg -
nancy. Studies have found that pregnant women often 
struggle with maintaining motivation to exercise dur -
ing pregnancy due to lack of time and tiredness [30, 34]. 
Moreover, 10–51% of women experience mental distress 
and/or mood disorders [35– 37] during pregnancy, exacer -
bating low energy and motivation to be active. Poor mood 
during pregnancy is also associated with compromised 
sleep quality [38, 39]. In turn, poor sleep quality and 
depressed mood may hinder the physical activity patterns 
that have been shown to significantly reduce depressive 
symptomatology and improve sleep quality during preg -
nancy [40, 41].
Little is known about the triadic relationship among 
physical activity, mood, and sleep during pregnancy 
and how they may collectively mitigate EGWG. Inde -
pendently, studies have found that both poor sleep and 
mood are associated with EGWG [26, 42–45]. Addition -
ally, women who exhibit high self-regulation have a bet -
ter understanding of how physical activity benefits their 
mood and sleep and may be more motivated to continue 
with activity into the postpartum period [46, 47]. Given 
these inter-connected relationships, EGWG interven -
tions may be more effective if they simultaneously target 
physical activity, mood, and sleep.
Social support is another factor that may mitigate 
adverse perinatal outcomes [48, 49]. Social support 
may reduce the risk of postpartum depression [49] and 
stress in the perinatal period [50]. Social support fur -
ther enhances the likelihood of engagement in regu -
lar physical activity in the perinatal period [51]. The 
My Baby My Move + (MBMM +) intervention provides 
social support by incorporating a peer-led intervention 
delivery platform. Peer-led support interventions are 
not only cost-effective [52] but may be a more acces -
sible and/or attractive option for pregnant women and 
increase the feasibility of participation. This paper pre -
sents findings related to the survey and qualitative inter -
view data that were collected to assess the feasibility of 
the MBMM + intervention based on the following con -
structs from Bowen’s feasibility framework: acceptability, 
demand, implementation, and practicality [53].
Methods
Study design
We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
to test the feasibility [53] of the MBMM + online inter -
vention compared to an online childbirth education 
control. The pilot RCT included two cohorts totaling 49 
participants. The first cohort (Fall Cohort) participated 
Page 3 of 14
 Leiferman et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:134 
 
soon after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic from 
August 2020 to November 2020 and included 21 par -
ticipants (intervention = 11 and control = 10). The sec -
ond cohort (Spring Cohort) consisted of 28 participants 
(intervention = 14 and control = 14) and was conducted 
between April 2021 and June 2021.
Recruitment
Pregnant women were recruited from healthcare clin -
ics as well as through advertisements on social media 
(e.g., Facebook, parent groups, and community organi -
zations) and listservs. Eligibility criteria for the first 
cohort included women 18–46  years of age; residing 
in Denver, Colorado, and surrounding areas with a 
singleton pregnancy between 8 and 14 weeks in gesta -
tion who were self-reportedly underactive (< 120  min 
of weekly moderate-intensity physical activity); willing 
to be randomized; and able to obtain medical clearance 
for physical activity during pregnancy. Given difficulties 
with recruiting pregnant women during the pandemic, 
eligibility criteria were expanded in the second cohort 
to a wider gestational age of 6–14 weeks and to include 
more active participants (< 150 min of weekly moderate-
intensity physical activity). Eligibility was determined by 
a MBMM + study team member administering a brief 
screener by phone (questions included age, gestational 
age, physical activity, general health, and availability 
to participate) or an online screener through Research 
Electronic Data Capture electronic (REDCap), a secure, 
online data capture system [54].
Procedures
Study participants’ approval was obtained from the Col -
orado Multiple Institutional Review Board (COMIRB 
#19–1366). Eligible participants provided informed 
electronic consent and completed an online baseline 
assessment (T1) using REDCap and obtained medical 
clearance to exercise from their healthcare providers in 
the form of a signed letter, which was then either deliv -
ered in paper form or scanned and emailed to the study 
team. Following the completion of the consent form 
and baseline assessment, participants were randomly 
assigned to either the intervention (MBMM + program) 
or control arm (childbirth education group) using a pre-
generated table program manual for either the interven -
tion or control.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the intervention and 
the control curriculum were adapted from their origi -
nal in-person formats to be delivered online. Instead 
of asking participants to meet at a recreation center 
to distribute materials, study team members dropped 
off study-related materials to each participant’s home 
(both intervention and control participants) including a Tanita scale and study arm-specific program manual. 
MBMM + intervention participants also received a yoga 
mat and pedometer.
MBMM + intervention
The guiding theoretical framework for the MBMM + inter -
vention was based on the social cognitive theory (SCT) 
and the social support theory [55]. These theories were 
selected as they include theoretical constructs such as self-
efficacy, behavioral skills (e.g., self-regulation and problem-
solving), and social support; all of which are strong change 
agents and shown to be effective in initiating and main -
taining physical activity [56, 57]. Intervention activities 
included goal setting, which was supported by the daily 
tracking logs, to promote self-monitoring, which is asso -
ciated with self-efficacy, and discussion around address -
ing barriers to regular physical activity (problem-solving). 
Intervention strategies and  theoretical  components are 
summarized in Table  1. These agents of behavioral change 
have been shown to not only increase physical activity 
but to sustain regular physical activity beyond the inter -
vention. The intervention also promoted the connection 
between participants through live online conversations 
and group discussions.
Up to 4 weeks prior to the first online MBMM + ses-
sion, intervention and control participants received a 
starter educational packet delivered to their homes by 
study team members. The packets included study-arm-
related material. The intervention educational packet 
included basic information related to exercising and 
managing stress during pregnancy. The MBMM + inter -
vention consisted of 16 online group sessions (60-–75-
min session, two times a week for 8  weeks). Sessions 
were held on weekday evenings, as these times were 
preferred by recruited participants. Each online inter -
vention group session consisted of a didactic portion 
in which educational materials were discussed live 
over Zoom, followed by an experiential physical activ -
ity component (i.e., walking or prenatal yoga facilitated 
by a certified prenatal yoga instructor). Live online 
didactic components covered information such as over -
coming barriers to physical activity, goal setting, self-
monitoring, problem-solving, topics related to mood 
(stress management, family/work balance, emotional 
eating, and the “wellness wheel”), sleep hygiene (set -
ting routines, avoiding stimulants, and environmental 
supports), and additional physical activity topics (man -
aging physical activity in postpartum and overcoming 
relapses). The second half of each session included an 
experiential component that involved a combination of 
meeting with peer leaders to discuss goals and barriers, 
designating time for walking at a moderate intensity 
based on national recommendations [58], and/or live 
Page 4 of 14 Leiferman et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:134 
online prenatal yoga (facilitated by a trained prenatal 
yoga teacher).
The MBMM + intervention was delivered by peers 
(i.e., women from the community who were either preg -
nant at the time and engaging in regular physical activ -
ity or a new mother (< 2 years postpartum) who regularly 
engaged in physical activity during a previous pregnancy. 
Peer leaders were recruited from local clinics, commu -
nity centers, and through social media to facilitate inter -
vention sessions. Eligible peer leaders participated in a 
hiring process (i.e., interviews) and were selected based 
on their community ties and ability to create positive 
atmospheres for pregnant participants. The PI and study 
team conducted peer leader training sessions (1.5–2  h, 
dependent on questions raised by peer leaders) before 
the onset of the intervention to cover topics including 
how to engage in safe and effective physical activity dur -
ing pregnancy, an overview of behavioral change through 
social cognitive theory, the behavioral skills targeted by 
the intervention, and ways to garner social support, lead -
ership and communication skills, and sensitivity train -
ing related to mental health. Each peer leader met with a 
small group of participants live over Zoom (an average of 
four participants per group) during each MBMM + ses -
sion to help participants set physical activity goals, brain -
storm ways to overcome potential barriers, and provide 
continual encouragement and motivation. Peer leaders 
recorded weekly goals for each participant in the small group on an online questionnaire submitted to the study 
team. The study team including the PI and program 
coordinator regularly met with the group peer leaders to 
debrief sessions and address any unanticipated issues that 
may have been submitted through participant feedback 
and to make any adaptations needed. Though the meet -
ings were held online rather than the intended in-person 
format, all distributed materials and guided discussions 
remained the same.
Control group
The study team developed a childbirth education cur -
riculum called “Baby Basics” for the control group to 
account for similar time and attention as the inter -
vention group. A packet of online materials related to 
various prenatal topics included the biology of preg -
nancy, mitigating symptoms of pregnancy-related 
nausea, selecting a health care provider, and establish -
ing a support system was distributed 4 weeks prior to 
the start of the 8-week online sessions. Though the 
control group also met online rather than the origi -
nally planned in-person format, all materials includ -
ing the curriculum booklet remained the same. All 
control group participants were invited to attend 16 
online sessions (2 × week for 8  weeks). Sessions lasted 
approximately 60 min and were held on weekday eve -
nings at the same time and for the same duration as the 
intervention group, as these times were preferred by Table 1 MBMM + MBMM+ Intervention strategies and theoretical components

recruited participants. The control curriculum included 
evidence-based recommendations for birth planning, 
postpartum care, breastfeeding, and infant care from 
entities such as the American Academy of Pediatrics 
[59] and the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists [60]. The curriculum was reviewed by a 
board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist. The control 
group facilitator was a member of the study team and 
a trained Certified Lactation Counselor and Childbirth 
Educator who received research training in EGWG and 
perinatal health behaviors.
Assessment instruments
At baseline (T1), participants in both the intervention 
and control arms were asked to complete objective 
assessments by logging their weight for three consecu -
tive days both pre-intervention (T1) and post-interven -
tion (T3) via photos of the provided scales. Intervention 
participants were also asked to complete weekly inter -
vention tracking logs, which consisted of daily reports 
of weight, physical activity, sleep, and mood patterns 
throughout participation in the MBMM + interven -
tion. Tracking logs were collected weekly by the study 
team through email. Participants were also asked to 
complete a survey at T1 that included the following val -
idated measures: the Leisure-Time Exercise Question -
naire [61] which is commonly used to measure exercise 
behavior in pregnant women, the Edinburgh Postnatal 
Depression Scale [62] which detects depressive symp -
toms in prenatal and postpartum women, and addi -
tional validated measures including the general anxiety 
disorder-7 scale (GAD-7) [63], the Perceived Stress 
Scale (PSS) [64], the Mindfulness Attention Awareness 
Scale-5 (MAAS-5) [65], and the Pittsburgh Sleep Qual -
ity Index (PSQI) [66].
A mid-point assessment (T2) was completed 6  weeks 
into the intervention for both intervention and control 
groups using REDCap and at their convenience. The T2 
assessment contained a modified survey questionnaire 
measuring weight, as well as questions from the Godin, 
the EPDS, GAD-7, PSS, MAAS-5, and PSQI. Finally, par -
ticipants from both the intervention and control groups 
completed the online survey consisting of the aforemen -
tioned validated measures and weight assessment at the 
end of the intervention (T3) (12  weeks post-baseline) 
using REDCap. Data from the weight measurements, 
tracking logs, and validated survey measures will be 
reported in subsequent manuscripts. Upon completion 
of the randomized controlled trial, participants had the 
opportunity to also participate in a survey that assessed 
the feasibility of the MBMM + intervention.Feasibility survey
The feasibility survey was based on Bowen’s feasibil -
ity framework [53]. The constructs included acceptabil -
ity, which assesses the reactions from the participants, 
demand, which estimates the use of the intervention, 
implementation, which focuses on the manner in which 
an intervention can be implemented as planned, and 
practicality, which explores the resources, time, and 
commitment required to successfully execute an inter -
vention. The feasibility survey questionnaire consisted of 
24 multiple choice and open-ended questions regarding 
different aspects of the program, including “What did 
you like most about The MBMM + Program?” (accept -
ability), "How helpful did you find the following program 
components: (i.e., electronic materials, daily tracking log, 
small group sessions with your peer leader)?” (imple -
mentation), and "How helpful did you find the following 
program components (i.e., attending program sessions, 
wearing the pedometer, setting goals)?” (practicality). 
After completion of the T1 and T2 assessment surveys, 
participants received a $30 electronic gift card.
Participants in both the intervention and control 
groups were also randomly selected to participate in 
semi-structured interviews at T3, in which 19 partici -
pants across both cohorts in the intervention and con -
trol groups participated. Interviews were conducted over 
Zoom by study team members (JL, RL, and JW) who are 
trained in collecting and analyzing qualitative data. Inter -
views included questions related to the feasibility of the 
intervention or control as well as the strengths and limi -
tations of each program. For example, participants were 
asked, “Which part of the program did you enjoy the 
most, and why?” (acceptability) and “Were you able to 
attend the sessions with your work schedule?” (practical -
ity). Interviews lasted approximately 25 min (12–37 min). 
After completion of each interview, participants received 
a $30 electronic gift card.
Peer leader assessments
Throughout the delivery of the intervention, the study 
team met weekly with the lead peer leader to debrief 
and address any arising issues. In addition to the weekly 
debriefing meetings, each peer leader completed session 
feedback forms that were monitored by the study team 
to assess the quality control and feasibility of the inter -
vention. Peer leaders noted the group’s progress on meet -
ing weekly goals, overall discussion related to identified 
barriers, recommended evidence-based strategies, and 
recommended action steps in weekly feedback forms. 
The study team reviewed these forms following each ses -
sion and monitored the intervention’s delivery to inform 
program implementation. Peer leaders also completed a 
brief role-related survey at T3. This survey assessed their 
Page 6 of 14 Leiferman et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:134 
likelihood of returning as a peer leader in the future, the 
impact and usefulness of the programmatic components 
(e.g., tracking logs, small group sessions, and didactic 
presentations) as well as their preparedness in effectively 
building relationships with the participants (e.g., training 
and study team support).
Assessing feasibility
Feasibility was assessed using a combination of surveys, 
interviews, and programmatic records. Descriptive sta -
tistics from continuous and categorical survey data were 
computed using SPSS software [67]. Qualitative inter -
views were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and 
stored on a password-protected computer. Transcripts 
were analyzed by members of the study team (RL, JW, 
and JL) using a deductive approach in ATLAS.ti [68] 
software based on constructs from Bowen’s feasibility 
framework [53]. Programmatic records were reviewed 
including attendance tracking, intervention tracking log 
completion, and peer leader feedback forms to inform 
findings related to demand and implementation of the 
MBMM + program.
Results
Demographics
Demographic data for the full sample can be found in 
Table  2. The average age of participants was 31.8  years, 
and the median age was 32. 64.3% of the total sample 
had no other children at home and 4.7% had 1 or more 
children. Approximately 22% of participants identified as 
Hispanic or Latino, 81.6% Caucasian, and 8.2% African 
American. Approximately 14.3% reported a household 
income of less than $49,999, 18.4% reported $50,000–
$74,999, 65.3% reported $75,000 or more. The sample 
was highly educated with approximately 81% a recipi -
ent of a college degree or more and 18.4% more than a 
college degree. Most participants (81.6%) had full health 
care coverage, only 8.4% had partial coverage or Medicaid 
(federally and/or state-funded health care). The majority 
of the sample were married (81.6%), while 18.4% were 
single or partnered. Over half of the participants (53.1%) 
had a BMI placing them in the “normal weight” category, 
while 8.2% were underweight, 20.4% overweight, and 
18.3% obese.
Feasibility survey and qualitative interview findings
A total of 14 MBMM + participants completed the fea -
sibility survey, and 15 intervention and 4 control par -
ticipants completed interviews at T3. Table  3 displays a 
detailed description of the survey and interview feasibil -
ity results.
Data analysis suggested high acceptability; 100% of 
participants stated they would recommend the program to another pregnant individual and all respondents 
were “somewhat satisfied” or “very satisfied” with the 
program. Participants appreciated how intervention 
materials were delivered in multiple formats (i.e., hard 
copies and electronically). Among peer leaders, the 
average score of enjoyment related to the facilitation of 
the group sessions was 4.6 (1 (not at all enjoyable) to 5 
(highly enjoyable)). All peer leaders found it “very help -
ful” to have a member of the study team attend each 
session. The control intervention was also deemed to be 
acceptable; over 85% of control group participants were 
satisfied with the program and another 72% of partici -
pants were “likely” or “extremely likely” to recommend 
the control program to a friend.
Demand was measured by attendance and participa -
tion in the MBMM + intervention sessions. Approxi -
mately 2/3 (68%) of intervention tracking logs were 
completed throughout the intervention, leading to 
68% of participants being categorized as “compliant” 
(attended 10 or more sessions) with the average com -
pliant participant attending 85% of sessions. While the 
final sample was small, there were many women who 
showed interest in the intervention and were not eligi -
ble. Interested women that were outside the gestational 
age parameters, were physically active for more than 
150 min per week, or did not receive medical clearance 
from their health care provider were not permitted to 
participate.
Implementation was measured by the ability of par -
ticipants and peer leaders to implement all intervention 
activities. Participants qualitatively shared how the inter -
vention materials (yoga mat, tracking logs, and manuals) 
enhanced their experience in the program and enabled 
them to participate in the weekly didactic and experien -
tial portions of the program. Participants also mentioned 
how the incentives (diaper raffles and gift cards) were 
helpful tools to increase accountability and attendance. 
One participant expressed appreciation for the delivery 
of materials: “I was at home with my other kiddos, so it 
was nice to have the materials brought to me” . Addition -
ally, all peer leaders completed 16/16 session feedback 
forms which suggest implementation success related 
to this component of the MBMM + program. The pro -
gram coordinator was present for all intervention group 
meetings, and the PI attended approximately half of the 
MBMM + sessions and at least two sessions for each 
cohort for the control group to assess the quality of pro -
gram delivery and implementation.
Practicality was assessed by the ease with which par -
ticipants could realistically participate in terms of time, 
space, and materials. Participants gave positive feedback 
regarding the timing of the sessions. For example, a fall 
cohort intervention participant stated: “I did like the 
Page 7 of 14
 Leiferman et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:134 
 
sessions later in the day, just because they fit with my 
work schedule” . Additionally, the online format enabled 
participation, as one member of the fall cohort explained: 
“I wouldn’t have been able to be part of the group if it 
wasn’t on Zoom” . Those with older children expressed 
that the flexibility of the remote model made it easier to 
attend because they did not have to find childcare.
Peer leader component
Peer leaders reported a pre-post change in prenatal exer -
cise and weight gain knowledge following the training 
with the study team. In addition to increased knowledge from the trainings, peer leaders enjoyed participating in 
the MBMM + intervention; 100% of peer leaders stated 
they would be peer leaders in the future and would rec -
ommend this program to pregnant women in their com -
munities, as either a participant or a leader.
Discussion
Our findings suggest that the MBMM + intervention is 
feasible. High acceptability was reported by both partici -
pants and peer leaders, suggesting that community-based 
intervention delivery through peer mentors may be an

Positive/negative effects on target participants The #1 identified barrier to being a peer leader in the future was time 
constraints
"We touched base on [stress management] in the class and I did 
learn some techniques to [reduce] this….And honestly, I really, really, 
really think that that is the one of the biggest reasons hy I’m prob -
ably not on [anxiety and depression] medication right now" -C1, VM, 
obese
"Our group developed such a great, comfortable, supportive rela-
tionship that was so exciting to watch develop throughout the pro -
gram." -C2, peer leader
"They [participants] loved the yoga! There was also a discussion 
about how much they appreciated that the curriculum included 
postpartum [material]. A few women mentioned that this 
was not already on their mind and that they were so happy we 
brought it up to think about and plan for their self-care once baby 
arrives. Postpartum depression acknowledgement was also appreci-
ated" -C2, peer leader
"I love the body scan activity [relaxation technique] and hope 
the women find these activities helpful. I have been incorporating 
them back into my life" -C2 peer leader
Ability of participants to carry out intervention activities "If the whole thing was in person, and we still tried to meet 
twice a week, I think that it would decrease participation just 
because of logistics, like needing a babysitter for the other kids. 
But a hybrid of having a couple in-person  options could be cool. 
-C2, FTM, overweight
"We were just in Las Vegas walking, making sure that I’m still walking 
like 15 min a day at least" -C2, VM, normal weight
"I still use [relaxation techniques] today. I still sit on the floor, I use my 
yoga mat. And I still stretch." -C1, VM, obese
"I think, [the program] is definitely applicable for all different types 
of people and levels [of fitness/knowledge] and all of it and so I 
absolutely would recommend it to anybody." -C2, FTM, overweight
"Our group chatted quite a bit, sometimes we needed more time, 
but we were able to stay on. When safe, the in-person walks would 
be so wonderful! Our group spoke about how we would really all 
like to do this" -C2, peer leader

studies indicate peer-delivered interventions (i.e., trained 
volunteer peers) may be as effective as clinical staff-
delivered interventions in helping women improve and 
maintain physical activity [71, 72]. Pregnant women have 
reported valuing interpersonal interactions with other 
pregnant women (i.e., peers they can identify with) to 
motivate and support behavior change such as increased 
physical activity [71, 73, 74].
Similar to prior research findings [75– 77], our 
MBMM + participants conveyed that peer leaders pro -
vided a sense of support and guidance for participants. 
A recent study measuring perceived social support dur -
ing pregnancy and early childhood also found positive 
effects of peer support on improving mood and reduc -
ing anxiety, stress, and isolation during pregnancy [78]. 
This was particularly true for primiparous participants 
in our study, who appreciated the peer leaders and 
veteran mother’s lived experiences of pregnancy and the postpartum period. In addition to the social and 
motivational support they offer, peer leaders from the 
community may be key in encouraging and translat -
ing prenatal health behaviors recommended by health -
care providers such as weight, exercise, sleep and stress 
management guidelines, and referral follow-ups.
The MBMM + intervention also demonstrated high 
demand among pregnant women due to high attend -
ance and completion of assessments. Many existing 
EGWG interventions focus on testing clinical interven -
tions in healthcare settings only [42, 79–81]. However, 
a recent systematic overview found that women who 
participated in group prenatal care (provider- and facil -
itator-led) had improved attendance rates of prenatal 
visits [82]. Additionally, utilizing peer leaders may miti -
gate reliance upon study team members and provide 
a low-cost opportunity for dissemination [71, 72] of 
evidence-based practices, improving the likelihood of Table 3 (continued)

Implementation Success or failure of execution 85% average attendance rate of compliant intervention (n = 17), 
68% average attendance rate of intervention group (n = 25) -C1 & C2 
participants
“And so I think the way to that it’s structured, I think, is definitely 
applicable for all different types of people and [physical ability] 
levels" -C2, FMT, overweight
“Facilitation went well, was happy to receive advice from the study 
team during my breakout. I feel like the guide for today’s session 
perfectly outlined what we needed to go over in the amount of time 
we had.” -C2, peer leader
"I think creating an environment where they didn’t feel that they 
were being reprimanded if they didn’t complete a goal, and that we 
could all talk through goals together helped" -C2 peer leader
Degree of execution All peer leaders found it "very helpful" for a study team member 
to attend sessions -C1 and C2 peer leaders
"[The study team] meeting me at work at the beginning, and then 
she dropped stuff off at my house. And I think that was probably 
the most helpful thing. Just having the supplies coming to me 
and not having to go drive anywhere." -C1, FTM, normal weight
Amount and type of resources needed to implement "Having a scale and a yoga mat, those were really huge perks 
of the program" -C2 FTM, overweight
Factors affecting implementation ease or difficulty "The gift cards help. I mean, I know, it’s not a lot, but I think if there’s 
some incentive, it always helps." -C1, FTM, normal weight
"I would say maybe an early afternoon session would work for my 
schedule, I mean, I was working part time in the evenings and then 
I’m trying to just get my household aligned and try to participate 
in the group and it was a little difficult" -C1, FTM, obese
“[The session was] really good, it was awesome getting the email 
from the study team reminding us of today’s meeting flow.” -C2, peer 
leader

future scalability. Interventions such as MBMM + that 
utilize a peer-led approach may translate to increased 
accessibility of prenatal care interventions that support 
the adoption of positive health behaviors and mitigate 
EGWG.
Implementation of the MBMM + was successful in 
this pilot study. The intervention was originally devel -
oped to be delivered in-person at community recreation 
centers but was adapted for online delivery due to the 
COVID pandemic. A recent study comparing in-person 
and online health coaching that targeted physical activ -
ity, weight change, and healthy eating demonstrated no 
significant differences between group formats for physi -
cal activity and weight change outcomes [83]. With an 
increasing demand for virtual programming following 
the COVID pandemic, a delivery modality of both online 
and in-person sessions (hybrid) may best support expect -
ant parents while also increasing social support during 
pregnancy and the postpartum period [84, 85].
Additionally, the idea of a hybrid format translated 
into high practicality related to participation in the 
MBMM + intervention. While participants expressed that 
in-person sessions may have fostered more social support, 
they also acknowledged the convenience of online ses -
sions, eliminating potential barriers to in-person partici -
pation (e.g., transportation, transportation costs, and cost 
of childcare), which have been cited as barriers to prenatal 
physical activity even before the pandemic [30].
Findings from this feasibility study suggest that the 
MBMM + intervention is feasible and also highlight ways 
to enhance the future refinement of MBMM + . Overall, 
participants reported that they enjoyed the small group 
discussions with their peer leaders. Some participants 
voiced a need for having even more time for a small 
group discussion in future programming. Additionally, 
participants suggested that they really enjoyed the stress 
management activities and desired more examples to be 
shared. A few participants suggested varying times when 
sessions were held would be helpful, particularly with 
some sessions being offered in the afternoons. Lastly, 
many participants conveyed a desire to meet again in the 
postpartum period.
Limitations
There are several limitations to this feasibility study. First, 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the intended curricu -
lum was created for in-person facilitation, which had to 
be adapted for the safety of participants and study team 
members, causing the need for the program curriculum 
to be adjusted to an online platform and virtual sessions 
via Zoom. This online programming changed the deliv -
ery of the experiential component (e.g., in-person walk -
ing and yoga sessions). In addition to the restructuring of the program, the recruitment of pregnant women pre -
sented a challenge. During the first cohort (Fall of 2020), 
COVID-19 vaccines were not yet available, and many 
pregnant women were unable to see their OBGYNS as 
early as recommended in their pregnancy for safety con -
cerns, thus limiting patient-clinic relations. The limited 
access to clinics/providers hindered the ability to obtain 
medical clearance forms. Recruitment issues resulted in 
a small, relatively homogeneous sample size.
Conclusion
In summary, these findings demonstrate that MBMM + is 
a feasible peer-led intervention with a high degree 
of acceptance, demand, implementation, and practi -
cality. Future research that tests a hybrid delivery of 
MBMM + with a larger sample size is needed. Findings 
from this feasibility study will inform the future refine -
ment of My Baby My Move + to be tested in a larger, 
well-powered RCT, as well as may inform the future 
development of other perinatal behavioral interventions 
that include peer-based facilitation.
