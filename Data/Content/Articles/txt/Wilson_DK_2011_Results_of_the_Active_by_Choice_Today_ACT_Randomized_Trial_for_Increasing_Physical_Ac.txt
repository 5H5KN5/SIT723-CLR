Objective— This study reports the results of the “Active by Choice Today” (ACT) trial for
increasing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in low-income and minority
adolescents.
Design— The ACT program was a randomized controlled school-based trial testing the efficacy
of a motivational plus behavioral skills intervention on increasing MVPA in underserved
adolescents. Twenty-four middle schools were matched on school size, percentage minorities,
percentage free or reduce lunch, and urban or rural setting before randomization. A total of 1,563
6th grade students (mean age, 11.3 years, 73% African American, 71% free or reduced lunch, 55%
female) participated in either a 17-week (over one academic year) intervention or comparison
after-school program.
Main Outcome Measure— The primary outcome measure was MVPA based on 7-day
accelerometry estimates at 2-weeks postintervention and an intermediate outcome was MVPA at
midintervention.
Results— At midintervention students in the intervention condition engaged in 4.87 greater
minutes of MVPA per day (95% CI: 1.18 to 8.57) than control students. Students in intervention
schools engaged in 9.11 min (95% CI: 5.73 to 12.48) more of MVPA per day than those in control
schools during the program time periods; indicating a 27 min per week increase in MVPA. No
significant effect of the ACT intervention was found outside of school times or for MVPA at 2-
weeks postintervention.
Conclusions— Motivational and behavioral skills programs are effective at increasing MVPA in
low-income and minority adolescents during program hours, but further research is needed to
address home barriers to youth MVPA.

National studies indicate that the increasing rate of childhood obesity is a major public
health problem and that prevalence rates of obesity among youth have more than tripled in
the last three decades (Levi, Vinter, Laurent, & Segal, 2008; Ogden, Carroll, Curtin, Lamb,
& Flegal, 2010). Reports indicate that 34.2% of adolescents and 39.5% of African American
adolescents are overweight or obese (Ogden et al., 2010). In addition, recent estimates
indicate that 50–92% of youth do not meet the national guidelines for engaging in regular
physical activity (PA) and PA declines by 50% between the elementary and middle school
years (Nader et al., 2008; Troiano et al., 2008; U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 2008). High levels of obesity have been found to be especially problematic among
minority and low-income youth who have less access to safe PA opportunities, and who
have lessfamily support for participating in PA (Molnar, Gortmaker, Bull, & Buka, 2004;
Pettit, Laird, Bates, & Dodge, 1997).
Few studies have examined the effects of school-based interventions on increasing PA in
underserved adolescent populations such as low income, ethnic minorities (Bayne-Smith,
Fardy, Magel, Schmitz, & Agin, 2004; Coleman, Tiller, Sanchez, et al., 2005; McKenzie et
al., 2004; Robinson et al., 2003; Story et al., 2003). In general school-based interventions
have had little or only modest effects on increasing PA and have resulted in little to no
change in PA outside of school settings (Baranowski, Anderson, & Carmark, 1998;
Gortmaker et al., 1999; Kelder, Perry, & Klepp, 1989; Killen et al., 1988; Saunders et al.,
2006; van Sluijs, McMinn, & Griffin, 2007). Where comprehensive school-based
interventions have typically included common behavior modification components including
self-monitoring of PA, goal setting, and behavioral skills training, little attention has been
given to involving youth in developing program ideas and PA choices that may enhanceWilson et al. Page 2

more intrinsic motivation, and thus, increase the likelihood of continued engagement in PA.
Previous studies have provided evidence for the importance of choice and self-initiated
behavior change on increasing intrinsic motivation for engaging in PA (Ferrer-Caja &
Weiss, 2000; Thompson & Wankel, 1980; Wilson et al., 2005), but large scale randomized
trials have not tested motivational and behavioral skills interventions specifically in low-
income, ethnic minority adolescents (Wilson, 2009; Wilson et al., 2002; Wilson et al.,
2005).
The ACT intervention integrated principles from Self-Determination Theory (Deci,
Koestner, & Ryan, 1999; Ryan & Deci, 2000) and Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1989,
2004). Self-Determination Theory (SDT) proposes that behavior changes that are motivated
by intrinsic factors such as novel, enjoyable, self-driven, and satisfying experiences will be
sustained over time. In the ACT intervention elements from SDT targeted the social
environmental during the after-school program for enhancing autonomy (choice), fun,
belongingness (engagement), and competence (challenges emphasizing non- competitive
play) for PA (Wilson et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2009). SCT theory assumes that individual-
cognitive factors, environmental events, and behavior are interacting and reciprocal
determinants of each other. Thus, both cognitive and social factors were integrated into the
development of a behavioral skills component of the ACT intervention for increasing PA.
The ACT intervention specifically targeted development of behavioral skills
(communication, reciprocity of social support, group goal setting, and behavioral
competence) for increasing PA outside of program days. In addition, the ACT after-school
program social environment (autonomy, choice, participation, belongingness, fun,
enjoyment, support) was designed to have a positive impact on cognitive mediators (self-
confidence, perceived competence) and motivational orientation (intrinsic motivation,
commitment, positive self-concept) to promote longterm PA behavior (Wilson et al., 2009,
2006, 2008). The primary aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of the motivational
and behavioral skills ACT intervention (vs. a control program– general health education) on
increasing PA at 2-weeks postintervention (primary outcome) and at midintervention
(intermediate outcome) in underserved adolescents.
Method
Study Design
The ACT trial is a group-randomized cohort design (12 intervention, 12 comparison schools;
Wilson et al., 2008). Schools were paired on school size, percentage of minorities,
proportion of free and reduced lunch, and urban or rural setting before recruitment and
randomization. Baseline measures were obtained by blinded measurement staff and schools
were randomized to condition using computer generated random numbers after the
completion of baseline measures. A total of 24 middle schools in South Carolina were
recruited to participate.
Recruitment
The recruitment flowchart is presented in Figure 1. All 6th grade students in 24 public
middle schools were eligible to participate if they had parental consent and agreed to study
participation and random assignment (Wilson et al., 2008). A total of 71% of our final
sample qualified for free or reduced lunch. Adolescents were excluded if they (1) had a
medical condition that interfered with PA, (2) were developmentally delayed such that the
intervention materials were not cognitively appropriate or, (3) were currently in treatment
for a psychiatric disorder. Presentations to parents and students were given at the school
orientations encouraging participation in the after-school program (Wilson et al., 2008).
During the presentations staff presented highlights of the program including no cost forWilson et al. Page 3

student participation, help with homework, having fun, and making friends at their new
school. Pep rallies and homeroom visits were two methods of recruitment that were
implemented during a second phase of recruitment to increase enrollment in the after-school
program (Wilson et al., 2008).
ACT Intervention
All of the theoretically based elements of the ACT intervention are summarized into the
ACT essential elements, which have been previously described (Wilson et al., 2009, 2008).
Specifically in the present study elements from SCT and SDT were combined to develop an
intervention that promoted behavioral skills (communication, reciprocity of social support,
group goal setting, and behavioral competence) for PA outside the program and a social
environmental approach during the after-school program for enhancing autonomy (choice),
fun, belongingness (engagement), and competence (challenges emphasizing noncompetitive
play) for PA. Noncompetitive play involved, for example, five-pass basketball in which all
players on the team had to handle the ball before shooting. This notion here was to create a
positive climate were belonging rather that winning was emphasized. Behavioral goal
setting was always performed as a group and involved making a public commitment (i.e.,
exercise for a set amount of minutes per day in the home environment) to create
belongingness and positive social support among peers in the program.
The ACT intervention was a 17-week program implemented on Mondays, Tuesdays, and
Thursdays for 2 hr after school. On Wednesdays students practiced what they had learned in
the after-school program in their home environment. A trained team leader, with expertise in
implementing physical activities in youth, provided the structure for the ACT intervention
program implementation (see also Wilson et al., 2009, for details on training). The program
had three main components: homework/snack (30 min), MVPA activities (60 min) that
students selected each week, and a behavioral skills and motivational component (30 min)
during which intervention staff worked with participants on developing strategies for
increasing their MVPA in their home environment. The General Health Education Program
(comparison program) focused on nutrition, stress management, drug prevention, and drop-
out prevention (with no PA component). The comparison program consisted of a homework/
snack (30 min) and three hands-on activities related to general health (30 min each). The
comparison program was held on the same days and times as the ACT intervention program
(Wilson et al., 2008).
Measures
The ACT intervention was 17 weeks in duration over the course of one academic school
year. Measures were collected at baseline (October), midintervention (9-weeks; December)
(intermediate outcome), and at 2-weeks postintervention (19-weeks; April). Process
evaluation data were obtained throughout the duration of the program (Wilson et al., 2009).
Process evaluation measures— The ACT trial incorporated a comprehensive process
evaluation methodology for assessing program implementation (Wilson et al., 2009, 2008).
The ACT process data for this report were assessed for summative purposes and were
collected by a trained, independent process evaluator using systematic observation of after-
school program activities to assess the fidelity of intervention implementation, dose
delivered, and reach of the intervention (Wilson et al., 2009, 2008). The process evaluation
questions can be summarized as: (1) Dose delivered  (completeness for all components), To
what extent were all planned components of the program provided to program participants?
(2) Fidelity  (for PA and behavioral skills components), To what extent was the social
environment autonomy supportive, (3) Reach , What percentage of the possible target group
attended each day of the program? Observational data capturing fidelity were scored on a 4Wilson et al. Page 4

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript
point scale with 1 representing lowest fidelity and 4 representing highest level of fidelity.
Mean scores were used to summarize the results. Fidelity measures for the PA and
behavioral skills component of the program included measures for clarity of rules and
expectations, choice, optimal challenge, and relatedness and belonging. The dose assessment
used yes or no response options.
The process evaluator observed the 2-hr program for each day of the program for 2 weeks (3
program days for 2 weeks) at three points in time, early (weeks 1 and 2), midpoint (weeks 8
and 9), and near the end (weeks 15 and 16) of the 17-week program. Fidelity data were not
obtained in comparison schools because of limited resources. Daily attendance was recorded
by the team leader at each school (across intervention and control schools) during program
days. Before implementation, the team determined that the minimal acceptable level of
fidelity was 3 on a 1–4 scale. In addition, the dose criteria was based on the percentage of
core activities that program staff completed during the sessions that were observed and that
before implementation, the team determined that the minimum acceptable level was 75%
completion.
Demographic measures— Participants’ age, sex, and race were self-reported at baseline.
Height and weight were assessed objectively at baseline and at 2-weeks postintervention.
Information about whether students were on the free or reduced lunch was obtained from
school records.
Motivational measures— The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), a multidimensional
measurement to assess participants’ subjective motivational experience related to PA was
measured at midintervention during the after-school program. This measure has been
previously validated (Deci, Eghrari, Patrick, & Leone, 1994). The instrument assesses
participants’ enjoyment, perceived competence, effort, value/usefulness, felt pressure and
tension, and perceived choice while performing a given activity, thus yielding six subscale
scores. The two subscales used in the present study included the: (1) interest/enjoyment
subscale and (2) perceived choice subscale. These subscales were theorized to be positive
predictors of both self-report and behavioral measures of intrinsic motivation and have been
shown to have adequate reliability and validity (McAuley, Duncan, & Tammen, 1987). In
the present study, perceived enjoyment was a positive endorsement count of six items (yes
or no format) with a mean of 4.19 ( SD = 2.15) and for perceived choice was a positive
endorsement count of five items (yes or no format) with a mean of 2.31 ( SD = 1.27).
PA monitoring (Accelerometers)— Assessments of MVPA were obtained with omni-
directional Actical accelerometers (Mini-Mitter, Bend, OR) at baseline, midintervention, and
at 2-weeks postintervention. Actical has been shown to have moderate to high correlations
between activity counts and energy expenditure of individuals measured concurrently by
other empirically tested accelerometers (e.g., MTI Actigraph, Caltrac, Tritrac) (Puyau,
Adolph, Vohra, Zakeri, & Butte, 2004). Participants wore an accelerometer over seven
consecutive days to calculate MVPA. Each weekday of Actical data was divided into five
intervals: 6–9 a.m., 9–2 p.m., 2–5 p.m., 5–8 p.m., and 8 p.m. to midnight while weekend
days used intervals of 6-11 a.m. and 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. as was done in a previous national
trial (Catellier et al., 2005). Data were recorded in 1-min epochs (Welk, Schaben, &
Morrow, 2004) and data was converted into time spent in moderate PA (3 to <6 METS),
vigorous PA (6 to <9 METS), and MVPA (3 to <9 METS) based on Actical-specific activity
count thresholds where MVPA = 1,500 to <6,500 and VPA =>6,500 (Puyau et al., 2004).Wilson et al. Page 5

Data Analysis
Mixed ANCOVAs with random effects appropriate for group randomized trials were used to
assess the effect of the ACT intervention (Donner & Klar, 2000) on MVPA. Using the
mixed effects notation (Pinheiro & Bates, 2000) at 2-weeks postintervention the statistical
model was:
where MVPApost ij is the realized value of MVPA at 2-weeks postintervention for individual
j in the ith school, β0 is the intercept across all schools, β1–β4 are the effects of covariates
(sex, ethnicity, and baseline BMI were included as covariates in all analyses where MVPA
was the outcome), and β5 is the difference in means between intervention and control
schools holding covariates constant. The random effect bi allows for intercepts to differ
between schools, thus accounting for any nonindependence of the outcome within schools.
The random error terms are assumed to be approximately normally distributed with a mean
of 0, and variances σ2b and σ2, respectively. Degrees of freedom for intervention effects
were constrained by the number of schools in the analyses.
An analysis was also conducted at the midintervention to test for intervention effects during
the time block when the after-school program was in session. The model was modified such
that the outcome variable was minutes of MVPA in each time block:
where i indicates schools, j indicates individuals, and t indicates time blocks. Program time
takes the value 1 if time block t was during the after-school hours on Monday, Tuesday, or
Thursday (program days) and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the parameter β5 represents the
difference in MVPA between intervention and control schools when students are not in the
after-school program, β6 is the effect of program time for the control schools, and β7 is the
difference in MVPA between intervention and control schools during the program time. This
is now a three level model, with random effects for the intercept and the interaction between
intervention and program time for individuals and for schools.
Multiple imputation was used (Schafer, 1997a) to provide unbiased parameter estimates and
standard errors for the intervention effect consistent with previous national trials (Catellier et
al., 2005; Murray, 1998; Taljaard, Donner, & Klar, 2008). The PAN package (Schafer,
1997b) implemented within R (R Foundation, 2008) was used to generate 40 imputations
with minutes of MVPA for each period log-transformed (for details see
http://www.psych.sc.edu/facdocs/wilson.html). Imputation was conducted at the student
level and baseline information for each student was included in the imputation model. If a
student was missing for an entire assessment period, (e.g., midintervention) then a summary
score representing average minutes of MVPA for the entire period was imputed. Time block
specific imputations take advantage of information from consecutive time blocks and time
of day effects present in that wave; attempting to impute time block specific effects when aWilson et al. Page 6

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript
student was not present for that assessment period was avoided because of highly variable
and sometimes extreme estimates. All reported standard errors were adjusted for missing
information, and reported intra class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were averaged across all
imputations.
Results
Baseline Analyses
Table 1 presents the baseline demographics of the study sample. Students were on average
11.3 years old and an average had a BMI of 22.9. Fifty-four percent of the participants were
female, and 73% were African American. Fifty-one percent of the youth were in the 85th
percentile for being overweight or obese. Random effects models using multiply imputed
data and incorporating clustering within schools found no significant differences between
intervention and control schools for any of these variables. An additional random effects
ANCOVA was conducted and examined differences in MVPA between intervention and
control groups at baseline. Students in intervention schools engaged in 0.19 min per day less
of MVPA (95% CI: −4.60 to 4.22) than those in control schools. This result was not greater
than that expected because of chance. The ICC for MVPA at baseline with covariates was .
012.
Because the time specific analyses at midpoint included only students present during
midintervention, additional analyses were conducted to evaluate differential attrition for this
time point. Absence at midpoint was used to predict ethnicity, sex, baseline age, baseline
BMI, and baseline MVPA using multiple imputation. No differences were found on sex,
baseline BMI, or baseline MVPA. Those not present at midpoint were older than those
present by .07 years (95% CI: .002 to .145). There was also an effect of ethnicity on
midpoint absence, African American students had a decrease in the logit of being absence at
midpoint of −.40 ( SE = .14); 28% of non-African American students and 23% of African
American students were absent at midintervention.
Process Evaluation
The attendance rates across intervention and control schools were very similar and has been
previously reported (Wilson et al., 2009). Averaged across intervention and control schools
the attendance rates were 46% for year 1, 64% for year 2, 57% for year 3, and 55% for year
4. Eleven of the 12 intervention schools met the overall dose delivered criteria with at least
75% of components delivered (see Table 2). Nine of the 12 intervention schools met the
fidelity criteria (3.0 or higher rating) for intervention implementation (see Table 2).
Analysis of Intervention Effects on MVPA
Midintervention— As expected, an examination of levels of MVPA across the course of
the study (see Table 3) showed a seasonal effect. Levels of MVPA decreased from baseline
to midintervention and increased from midintervention to 2 weeks postintervention.
Furthermore, as the intervention took place on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, it is
notable that MVPA in the ACT intervention group appeared to increase from baseline on
those program days. As compared to baseline, MVPA for the control group was lower at
midintervention across every day. Differences in this trend between ACT and the control
group were examined using a mixed effects ANCOVA, and demonstrated a significant
intervention effect at midintervention (see Table 4). The ACT intervention was successful at
reducing the seasonal decrease in MVPA; students in the ACT intervention engaged in 4.87
greater minutes per day of MVPA (95% CI: 1.18 to 8.57) than those in the control condition.
The effect size for this increase across the entire week is Cohen’s D = .24. The ICC for
MVPA at midintervention was .024.Wilson et al. Page 7
Health Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 August 13.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript
Further analyses were conducted to determine the effects at midintervention (including only
students with actical data at midintervention, N = 1079). An analysis was conducted with
minutes of MVPA from each of the 5 time periods per day for the week at midintervention
as the outcome. The program time indicator specifies that an observation was during the
after-school program and the interaction between program time and treatment (“Program
Time*TX”, see Table 5) indicated the treatment effect on MVPA during the time that the
program was in session. Results (see Table 5) demonstrated that students in the ACT
intervention schools engaged in 9.11 min (95% CI: 5.73 to 12.48) more of MVPA than those
in control schools during the three time periods in which the after-school programs were
conducted; indicating a 27 min per week increase in MVPA.
MVPA at 2-weeks postintervention— A mixed effects ANCOVA demonstrated no
significant differences in MVPA between intervention and control groups at 2-weeks
postintervention (see Table 4). The correlation between baseline and 2-week
postintervention MVPA was 0.37, p < .05. The ICC of the outcome was .019, and there was
little missing information.
Motivational measures during midintervention— Additional analyses were
conducted to look at differences between ACT and control schools student perceptions of
enjoyment and choice of activities based on the IMI subscales (Deci, Eghrari, Patrick &
Leone, 1994) at midintervention during the after-school program. A mixed effects
ANCOVA demonstrated a significant intervention effect such that students in the ACT
program reported higher levels of program enjoyment than students in the control program
(B = .69, SE = .29, df = 22; p < .05). Students in the ACT intervention also reported having
greater choice of activities than students in the control program (B = .69, SE = .29, df = 22;
p < .05). The effect sizes for both effects were Cohen’s D of .32 and .29, respectively.
Postintervention Focus Groups
At postintervention three focus groups were conducted with students ( n = 19 students) at
two ACT intervention schools to determine what barriers prevented youth from continuing
PA after the program ended. Students reported four themes related to barriers (1) competing
demands at home, (2) not being motivated without teachers, (3) lack of parent involvement
such as “could not go outside because parents were not home” and “parents made it hard to
exercise at home,” and (4) environmental barriers such as “bad weather” and “safety
concerns.”
Discussion
This is the first randomized trial to demonstrate a significant effect of increasing MVPA in
low-income and ethnic minority adolescents in an after-school program using carefully
measured accelerometry estimates. The intervention youth demonstrated a significant
increase in MVPA as compared to control students at midintervention, however, the
intervention effects were not sustained at 2-weeks postintervention. Focus group data
indicated that these youth had a number of barriers in the home environment and in
particular parents lack of involvement made it hard for them to continue engaging in PA.
Students in the intervention schools engaged in significantly greater minutes of MVPA per
day than those in the control schools at midintervention. This finding is consistent with
McKenzie et al. (2004) who evaluated a school-based physical education intervention on
increasing MVPA in middle school students (55% minorities). The 2 year intervention
resulted in a 3 min per session increase in MVPA based on observational evaluation
methods of lessons. Our results indicated an approximate 9 min increase per day in MVPAWilson et al. Page 8
Health Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 August 13.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript
across program days, which was somewhat greater than the increase observed in
McKenzie’s et al. (2004) study. The weekly increase in the present study was equivalent to a
27 min increase in MVPA which is clinically meaningful in that it could shift youth into a
higher level of health benefit based on national recommendations (Dunn et al., 1999).
Although other investigators have conducted school programs to increase MVPA, they have
not focused on low-income or minority populations (Simon et al., 2008) and many studies
have not demonstrated intervention effects in school-based settings (Baranowski, Anderson,
& Carmark, 1998; Beet, Bieghle, Erwin, & Huberty, 2009; McKenzie & Lounsbery, 2009;
Salmon et al., 2007; van Sluijs, McMinn, & Griffin, 2007). Our trial further expands on
previous research by utilizing accelerometry estimates rather than relying on self-report data
(Beet et al., 2009).
The lack of an effect of increasing MVPA beyond the school environment is consistent with
other studies that have shown substantial barriers for PA in underserved youth (Monge-
Rojas, Garita-Arce, Sanchez-Lopez, & Colon-Ramos, 2009). Minority and low-income
youth have been shown to have less access to safe and well-resourced PA opportunities
(Molnar et al., 2004), have less family support, and greater barriers for participating in
regular PA (Molnar et al., 2004; Pettit et al., 1997). Future interventions for underserved
youth need to intervene in multiple contexts, such as in the school and home settings
simultaneously to develop cost-effective programs that go beyond the school setting. A
multiple systems approach that includes school and home environments could have a
synergistic impact on increasing MVPA in underserved youth. Although some interventions
have incorporated school and family components in promoting increases in PA among youth
(Luepker et al., 1996; Manios, Kafatos, & Mamalakis, 1998; Sallis et al., 1997; Story et al.,
2003; Warren et al., 2003) few studies have specifically done so in adolescents’ (Salmon et
al., 2007) and few have focused on underserved populations or have used objective
measures of PA (Beet et al., 2009). Most multilevel school and family based programs have
not been effective for promoting PA and have not been design to directly test synergistic
effects (Caballero et al., 2003; Coleman et al., 2005; Fitzgibbon et al., 2005; Goran &
Reynolds, 2005; Paradis et al., 2005).
Few studies have adequately reported dose and fidelity estimates of program implementation
(Beet et al., 2009). One issue that requires further investigations is attendance rates, as some
research has demonstrated, that students who attend 40% or greater of PA sessions show
greater increases in physical fitness (Gutin, Yin, Johnson, & Barbeau, 2008; Yin et al.,
2005). In the ACT trial, analyses that considered differential attendance rates did not change
the overall findings presented in this report. Based on the current “state of the art” it appears
that school level randomization has been lacking and extensive assessment of PA through
accelerometry measures and follow up have been limited. Given that the ACT trial
addressed all of these issues it provides a standard on which to promote future research
efforts especially in underserved youth who are at increased risk of developing obesity and
who have a number of barriers in the home environment that may limit opportunities to
engage in regular PA.
There are limitations to the present study that should be noted. As summarized in this study,
the dose and fidelity estimates during the first year of schools were not adequate which may
have weakened the overall effects reported. However, our analytical methods using multiple
imputations allowed us to utilize the maximum amount of information possible to evaluate
intervention effects. Further research is needed that continues to utilize these methods for
capturing missing values in an unbiased manner with accelerometry measures in youth.
This study provides evidence that a novel integration of motivational and behavioral skills
into an after-school intervention was effective in increasing MVPA during the interventionWilson et al. Page 9

period in low-income, ethnic minority youth, but not at 2-weeks postintervention. Our study
indicated a threefold great effect of the intervention on increasing MVPA than previous
studies that included minority youth (McKenzie et al., 2004). Qualitative data revealed a
number of barriers in the home including lack of parental involvement. Thus, future
interventions are needed to intervene in multiple contexts, such as in the school and home
settings simultaneously, to develop a potential synergistic impact of programs in
underserved youth. Consistent with recent national recommendations for prevention of
childhood obesity (Davis et al., 2007) our ACT trial used a rigorous approach to increase PA
in low-income and ethnic minority adolescents. Given the alarming rates of obesity and risk
for morbidity and premature mortality in this underserved population, this study sets the
stage for continued scientific investigation to further enhance the impact and effects of
interventions beyond the school setting on improving the health outcomes in low-income
and minority youth.
