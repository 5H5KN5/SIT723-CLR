Abstract
Background: The emergence of dissemination and implementation (D&I) science has driven a rapid increase in
studies of how new scientific discoveries are translated and developed into evidence-based programs and policies.
However, D&I science has paid much less attention to what happens to programs once they have been implemented.
Public health programs can only deliver benefits if they reach maturity and sustain activities over time. In order to
achieve the full benefits of significant investment in public health research and program development, there must be
an understanding of the factors that relate to sustainability to inform development of tools and trainings to support
strategic long-term program sustainability. Tobacco control programs, specifically, vary in their abilities to support and
sustain themselves over time. As of 2018, most states still do not meet the CDC-recommended level for funding their
TC program, allowing tobacco use to remain the leadin g cause of preventable disease and death in the USA.
The purpose of this study is to empirically develop, test, and disseminate training programs to improve the
sustainability of evidence-based state tobacco control programs and thus, tobacco-related health outcomes.
Methods: This paper describes the methods of a group randomized, multi-phase study that evaluates the empirically
developed “Program Sustainability Action Planning Training ”and technical assistance in US state-level tobacco control
programs. Phase 1 includes developing the sustainability action planning training curriculum and technical assistance
protocol and developing measures to assess long-term program sustainability. Phase 2 includes a group randomized
trial to test the effectiveness of the training and technical assistance in improving sustainability outcomes in 24 state
tobacco control programs (12 intervention, 12 comparison). Phase 3 includes the active dissemination of final training
curricula materials to a broader public health audience.
Discussion: Empirical evidence has established that program sustainability can improve through training and technical
assistance; however, to our knowledge, no evidence-based sustainability training curriculum program exists. Therefore,
systematic methods are needed to develop, test, and disse minate a training that improves the sustainability of
evidence-based programs.

Background
Demonstrating the effective implementation of a program
is only the first step in influencing the health and wellness
of a target population. For a population to experience the
benefits of an implemented evidence-based intervention,
the intervention must be sustained over time. Program
sustainability is a complex process, often fraught with
challenges [ 1–4]. Research consistently indicates that even
effectively implemented interventions risk failure when
funding, planning, or training ends [ 5–8]. In fact, it is esti-
mated that up to 40% of programs end within 2 years of
losing funding [ 9]. Failure to sustain an implemented pro-
gram negatively impacts communities through loss of
trust in public health initiatives and waste of valuable re-
sources [ 10].
As of 2013, 42.1 million —or one in five —adults in the
USA smoke, leading to an estimated 480,000 deaths per
year due to tobacco use [ 11]. According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), if smoking con-
tinues at its current rate, more than five million of today ’s
youth will die prematurely from smoking-related disease
and the economic cost will rise to over $300 billion per
year [ 11]. All the while, tobacco use has long been identi-
fied as a major preventable cause of death and disease
[12]. Given the burden of tobacco use, it is imperative that
high-quality, state tobacco control programs exist and are
sustained.
The goal of this study is to increase capacity for sustain-
ability among evidence-based tobacco control programs.
Although all 50 states have implemented evidence-based
tobacco control programs and policies, each program var-
ies in its ability to support and sustain itself over time. To-
bacco control funding directly correlates with US adult
smoking rates in that states with more funding have lower
smoking rates [ 12]. Between 1985 and 2003, adult smok-
ing prevalence declined from 29.5 to 18.6%, due to in-
creases in tobacco control funding [ 12]. Farrelly et al.
estimated if, starting in 1995, all states funded their TC
programs at the optimal levels recommended by the
CDC, there would have been 2.2 million to 7.1 million
fewer smokers by 2003 [ 12]. Given the established evi-
dence for state tobacco control program and the work left
to do in the field, it is essential to sustain the state tobacco
control programs, to both improve quality of life and
reduce the massive healthcare risks incurred by
smoking-related illness [ 12].
This study defines sustainability as the existence of
adaptive structures and processes that enable a program
to effectively implement and institutionalize evidence-
based policies and activities over time [ 1]. Empirical evi-
dence has established that program sustainability can be
improved through in-person, hands-on, action-oriented
training and technical assistance [ 13–16]. Research also
highlights the importance of creating an action plan tomove sustainability progress forward [ 17]. Sustainability
planning predicts program survival and post-launch fund-
ing [17]; however, to date, no evidence-based sustainability
training curriculum exists. While there is a growing body
of research on aspects affecting sustainability [ 2–6,18], lit-
tle has been done to translate the components of program
sustainability capacity into practical guides and tools for
practitioner utilization. Thus, this study aims to develop
and validate the first evidence-based program sustainabil-
ity action planning model and training curriculum and ul-
timately disseminating training curricula materials to
broader public health audiences.
Methods/design
Study design
This study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, seeks
to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a program
sustainability action planning training curriculum in in-
creasing the capacity for sustainability among evidence-
based tobacco control programs. The study will be di-
rected by a multidisciplinary team of researchers and prac-
titioners with expertise in: program sustainability
assessment, tobacco control program and policy evalu-
ation, planning and training, and dissemination and im-
plementation science. This study team consists of
researchers from the Prevention Research Center (PRC) at
Washington University in St. Louis with collaboration
from the Center for Public Health Systems Science
(CPHSS) at Washington University in St. Louis and CDC ’s
Office on Smoking and Health (OSH). The Institutional
Review Board of Washington University in St. Louis and
the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee approved
all study procedures.
The study involves three interconnected phases. Phase
1 consists of the development of a sustainability action
planning training curriculum including the creation of
an interactive workbook and design of a training work-
shop. Additionally, Phase 1 will focus on the develop-
ment of surveys, interviews, and record abstraction
protocols to collect programmatic, organizational,
community-level, and funding data associated with pro-
gram sustainability and institutionalization. Phase 2 is a
group randomized, mixed methods study designed to as-
sess the training curriculum ’s effectiveness in increasing
the capacity for sustainability among 24 statewide to-
bacco control programs. This involves two parallel study
arms with 12 intervention states and 12 pair-matched
comparison states. States will be paired together accord-
ing to an analysis of programmatic factors, then ran-
domly selected into intervention or comparison groups.
Those programs placed in the intervention condition
will receive numerous training strategies, including
in-person sustainability action planning training work-
shops, ongoing technical assistance, and periodicVitale et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:126 Page 2 of 12
communications regarding project progress as well as
recent program sustainability and tobacco control news.
State programs participating in the comparison condi-
tion will also be encouraged to create a sustainability
plan, but they will receive neither training workshops
nor technical assistance. Phase 3 will focus on both re-
fining the training curriculum based on evaluation fol-
lowing implementation and actively disseminating all
training materials to broader public health audiences.
Figure 1depicts a visual of the study schema, describing
the components of each study phase. Some aspects of
phase 1 have been completed while phase 2 planning
and recruitment is underway.
Conceptual model
The conceptual model for the study is driven by the the-
ory of change [ 13,19–21]. Figure 2illustrates the theory
of change conceptual model for this project, adopted from
Johnson ’s conceptual model of sustainability planning for
substance abuse service coalitions [ 13,21]. The model
outlines a set of causal factors that help in evaluating the
effectiveness of the program sustainability action planning
model and training curriculum in increasing capacity forsustainability. Sustainability planning played out through a
six-step process can directly affect sustainability readiness
and capacity for sustainability as defined by enhancement
of programmatic and organizational attributes, commu-
nity stakeholders, and funder support. Increased readiness
and capacity for sustainability will mediate the effect of
the sustainability action planning training on sustainability
success in the form of institutionalization. The study de-
fines institutionalization as the continuous integration of
the program into normal operations of the organizational
system. The resulting health impact follows the sustain-
ment of the evidence-based program over time and is
regarded as a decrease in incidence of tobacco use, cancer,
and chronic disease.
Study audience
The target audience for this study includes statewide to-
bacco control programs and their stakeholders, drawn
from diverse organizations such as state and local health
departments, community-based organizations, univer-
sities, and policymakers. All participants will be
non-institutionalized adults ages 18 and over. The only
exclusionary criterion is that participants must be
Fig. 1 Study schemaVitale et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:126 Page 3 of 12
involved in their state ’s tobacco control program and
must be selected by their state program manager as a
stakeholder. Historically, tobacco control programs en-
dure constant changes in funding and political support
[12]. Similarly, sustainability is a pressing issue in the
public health sector as a whole [ 3,8]. Finite funding op-
portunities propel many public health programs, so
changes in funding often curtail hard-earned advance-
ments. Therefore, phase 3 will focus on wider dissemin-
ation to a broader audience. To this end, measures and
evaluation criteria were designed for future adaptation
to any public health program or initiative.
Phase 1: Development of curriculum and measures
Training curriculum development
The study team will develop and deliver a series of
in-person training workshops to educate stakeholders
about program sustainability and facilitate their comple-
tion of a sustainability action plan. The study team will de-
velop a workbook for each participant to use with the
training curriculum. The workshop will elaborate upon
previous trainings conducted by CPHSS and empirical
recommendations [ 22–28] to incorporate Kolb ’s four-step
experiential learning model [ 22]. Experiential learning is a
process comprised of four elements: concrete experience,
reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and ac-
tive experimentation [ 10]. Developed with this in mind,
the theory and the model of this study emphasize active
engagement. The core principles of active engagement in-
clude defining and implementing the program (concrete
experience), assessing the program (reflective observa-
tion), developing and executing the action plan (abstract
conceptualization), evaluating sustainability, and reasses-
sing and modifying (active experimentation). Fig. 3illus-
trates the alignment of these principles with the study
design. Providing balanced learning experiences andincorporating virtual, remote, and hands-on sessions and
reflection —as the current study will do —have shown to
lead to deeper learning and maximum information reten-
tion [ 22,29].
Complementary to these core principles, the study
team set four goals to guide the development of the
training curriculum workbook: (1) to offer an interactive
guide for participants to return to as a sustainability
planning resource; (2) to spark engaging, transparent,
and collaborative discussions; (3) to communicate with a
range of community-oriented organizations; and (4) to
remain readable across print and digital formats. These
goals, in combination with the experiential learning
framework, will motivate the study team to design inter-
active activities throughout, including fill-in visualiza-
tions, journaling segments, and discussion prompts. In
each section, the audience will apply educational mater-
ial to the context of their program. The training work-
book will mirror the format of the action planning
workshop, and stakeholders will reference the workbook
throughout the course of the training. In the following
years, the workbook will serve as a resource encouraging
proactive and accountable use of the action plan and ac-
companying sustainability planning resources.
Technical assistance after the training will promote
continuation of the action plan and provide trouble-
shooting for the intervention states. This is an essential
step in the action planning process to help build each
state program ’s capacity for quality implementation of
the action plan. Following each intervention, flexible and
proactive technical assistance with clearly defined re-
sponsibilities and tailored messaging will strengthen
communication between providers and recipients [ 30].
Through consultations with the advisory board and data
from an ongoing literature review, the study team
elected to issue quarterly feedback, provide on-call
Fig. 2 Sustainability theory of change conceptual modelVitale et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:126 Page 4 of 12
troubleshooting assistance from academic experts, allow
for state programs in the intervention condition to share
insights, and send custom activities and tools in the
years following training.
Data collection and management
Following recommendations from the advisory board and
tobacco control experts, the study team will collect data
primarily using record abstraction. This will help to allevi-
ate the burden of an intensive, all-encompassing survey or
interview. However, because it may be infeasible to collect
all data points through program records, the study team
has also developed a key informant interview tool to col-
lect remaining information. The interviews will be con-
ducted via a 15 –20-min phone interview with state
program managers or any other qualified surrogate.
Additionally, all answers will be recorded, transcribed, and
reviewed for completeness and accuracy. An online
Qualtrics survey will be developed with identical questions
for the convenience of state program managers that prefer
not to complete a phone interview. Each interview or sur-
vey will be coded by assigned team members and checked
for inter-rater reliability.
Much of the record data for this study will come from
annual state-level reports to the Office of Smoking and
Health at the CDC. These reports address fulfillment
criteria for the DP15-1509 funding announcement and
describe the infrastructure, personnel, and activities of
state tobacco control programs in detail. These funding
announcements are a requirement of state programs, set
by the CDC, to complete yearly reports of progress,
goals, and challenges in order to receive federal funding.The study team has strategically timed this project to co-
incide with the annual release of these reports. In
addition to the CDC reports, other data will be collected
via secondary data sources, including the American
Lung Association ’s annual State of Tobacco Control re-
port [ 31] and the annual Healthy Americans report is-
sued by Trust for America ’s Health [ 32].
Phase 1 also includes production of a codebook to
organize and explain the programmatic and organizational
data collected, as well as a record abstraction protocol.
The project codebook will align each data point within
four key areas (programmatic attributes, organizational
attributes, community-level factors, and funder support) [ 33].
Measures
The program sustainability framework was developed
from previous research completed by the CPHSS team
through an extensive literature review, concept mapping,
and expert input [ 1,33]. The framework defines the in-
ternal and external factors operationalized into eight
domains that affect an organization ’s capacity for sustain-
ability including environmental support, funding stability,
partnerships, organizational capacity, program evaluation,
program adaptation, communications, and strategic plan-
ning. The Program Sustainability Assessment Tool
(PSAT) consists of 40, 7-point Likert-scale items orga-
nized into the eight domains of the program sustainability
framework.
Table 1describes these variables, their type, their
method of collection, and their basis in previous program
sustainability research. The presence or absence of the ac-
tion planning training curriculum is both the intervention

and independent variable for this study. Program sustain-
ability is the study ’s main outcome measure and will be
measured by four empirically established indicators of
institutionalization: (1) the anchoring of a program in law,
regulation, or other organizational rules; (2) the inclusion
of a program in the regular organizational budget; (3) the
percentage of an organizational budget allotted to the pro-
gram; and (4) the percentage of CDC-recommended to-
bacco control funding level spent [ 8,33]. The PSAT scores
will be evaluated as an outcome against these four con-
ventional measures.
Mediators
As aforementioned, increased readiness and capacity for
sustainability will mediate the effect of the workshop on
sustainability success or institutionalization. Each medi-
ating variable contributing to sustainability readiness
consists of several factors [ 33]. Programmatic attributes
include amount of funding allotted, diversity of funding
sources, staff size and commitment, leadership abilities
and commitment, and the overall scope and mission of
the program [ 33]. Because program manager turnover
may result in changes to planning, the study team will
create a variable to account for the potential influence of
a change in leadership. Associated organizational attri-
butes include the organization ’s size, the organizations
leadership ’s perceptions of the program, and the involve-
ment of organizational leadership and staff in the pro-
gram [ 33]. Community-level factors include the number
of stakeholders involved in the program [ 33] and the
presence of a coalition. Finally, funder support concerns
the percentage of the program ’s budget covered by exter-
nal resources [ 13,33–35].
Through a systematic literature review, the study team
identified indicators of program sustainability that further
characterized each key metric [ 33,34,36–46]. In this re-
view, objective measurements of the program became ap-
parent (e.g., manager tenure, staff positions [ 41], turnover
[33,47] training opportunities [ 42], and the frequency and
magnitude of funding changes [ 46]). In the community,
the presence and operations of a coalition took on particu-
lar emphasis as a predictor of sustainability and
institutionalization [ 33,39]. After the review, the study
team mapped each candidate variable to one of four
categories (programmatic attributes, organizational attri-
butes, community-level factors, and funder support).
Where applicable, the study team contextualized the vari-
able for tobacco control practice. For example, for a stand-
ard measure of coalitions, the study team consulted the
CDC ’sBest Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control
Programs [47] to detail types of organizations tobacco
control programs partner with, e.g., retail tobacco organi-
zations, healthcare providers, voluntary health organiza-
tions, educational organizations, etc. This tactic led to thediscovery of additional coalitional measures, such as the
existence of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) be-
tween tobacco control programs and universities [ 45].
While in initial development, these indicators were
subject to several rounds of review by academic investi-
gators on the team. In April of 2018, the study team as-
sembled a panel of expert academics and practitioners to
deliberate the list of candidate variables and discuss a
strategy for collecting the data. This produced a final list
of mediating variables. The study team then aligned
these indicators with items annually reported by state to-
bacco control programs to the Office on Smoking and
Health at the CDC.
Phase 2: Implementation with state tobacco control programs
Overview
Phase 2 will include a longitudinal group randomized-
effectiveness trial to determine differences in organizational
and programmatic measures and program sustainability
assessment scores between intervention and compari-
son groups. There will be three staggered recruitment
stages with 12 intervention states and 12 paired com-
parison states. Participating intervention state programs
will work closely with the study team to create and
carry out their action plan through involvement in
technical assistance activities. Although comparison
states will receive neither the training curriculum nor
technical assistance, they will be given resources to in-
dependently construct and car ry out a sustainability ac-
tion plan. Evaluation measures will occur at three time
points (baseline, year one, and year two) and will in-
corporate PSAT scores, program record abstraction,
and key informant interview data.
State selection and recruitment
State tobacco control program selection and recruitment
are based on four criteria: policy progress, resources,
need, and previous participation in sustainability train-
ing. These characteristics were used to stratify the states
when they were assigned to each condition (intervention
or comparison). Stratification was important to help en-
sure the comparability of the grouped states.
Tobacco control policy progress is operationalized as
the American Lung Association ’s (ALA) smoke-free
score for each state [ 31]. This analysis uses national
adult smoking rates within each state. Funding is mea-
sured as the actual amount of money spent on tobacco
control as a percentage of the amount of spending rec-
ommended by the CDC. Figure 4depicts how each of
the 50 states in the USA was divided into quadrants
based on their ALA scores and CDC-recommended
funding. The sizes of the points for each state represent
adult smoking rates. The 16 states in quadrant I
(top-right) include states that scored well for smoke-freeVitale et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:126 Page 7 of 12
policy although their tobacco control programs are
funded at relatively low amounts. Moving counter-
clockwise around the plot, the ten states in quadrant II
also have high ALA scores yet have higher funding for
programs. The nine states in Quadrant III and 15 states
in Quadrant IV have the lowest ALA scores with higher
and lower funding rates, respectively. All quadrants ex-
hibit variation in adult smoking rates.
The goal is to select three states from each quadrant
per group, for a total of six per quadrant, with varying
levels of need to build comparable and diverse groups.
For example, from each quadrant, two states were se-
lected with relatively low-smoking rates, two from the
middle, and two with high-smoking rates. All states se-
lected have not previously participated in sustainability
action planning training. Based on a priori analysis, the
study team estimated a range of effect size using data
from a natural experiment. The data consists of pre- and
post-PSAT averages from previous work with five to-
bacco control programs that received action planning
training and five programs that did not. To determine
effect size, ttests of differences-in-means were con-
ducted for the two groups using the changes in PSAT
scores between pre- and post-intervention data. Thestandardized differences in tstatistics yielded an effect
size of 1.25, which is a large effect size according to
Cohen ’s criteria [ 48]. Using the R statistical environment
with packages from Del Re [ 49] and Champely [ 50], the
effect size with power = 0.8 and α= 0.05 projects the ne-
cessary sample size to be approximately nine (programs)
per group. Since these calculations are based on natural
experiments, the study team chose to conservatively
propose a sample size larger than calculated due to
changes in recommended action planning. This brought
the sample size to 12 per group. This sample is sufficient
to measure the main goal of the study, which is to dis-
cern whether the training and accompanying PSAT tool
significantly increase institutionalization of state tobacco
control programs [ 49–51].
State selection and enrollment will be staggered by
three pairs at a time during the first two stages of re-
cruitment and six pairs during the final stage over years
two and three. The study manager will invite each of the
chosen states ’program managers to participate in the
study. The program managers will then select between
five and 12 key program stakeholders or partners within
their state to participate. After enrollment and baseline
data collection, the paired states will be randomly
Fig. 4 State selection matrixVitale et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:126 Page 8 of 12
assigned into intervention or comparison groups via
simple random concealed allocation performed by the
statistician. If any program declines to participate, a re-
placement will be selected from the same quadrant by
identifying the state with the closest ALA scores and
funding levels.
Intervention delivery
In each intervention state, a primary group of tobacco-
control stakeholders and study-team members will col-
laborate to identify and define programmatic aspects of
the statewide initiative, including program mission and
vision, target populations, strengths and weaknesses, and
key partners within and outside of the program.
Additionally, these states will participate in sustainability
action planning that responds to an in-depth discussion
of aggregate PSAT results by addressing particular
framework domains. The workshops will consist of a
two-day presentation at the state health department. On
the first day, facilitators will guide states through defin-
ing their tobacco control program and reflecting on their
PSAT scores. Participants will consult their scores to
frame appraisals and activities addressing strengths and
weaknesses of their program and guide the creation of
their sustainability action plan. The second day consists
of prompts related to creating specific, measurable, at-
tainable, realistic, and time-sensitive (SMART) objec-
tives; activities for participants to link areas of their
program and evidence-based topics in sustainability;
templates for determining actions and a timeframe; and
guidance on creating clear outcomes. The creation of
the sustainability action plan is the focal point of the
training. The training curriculum will emphasize specific
and concrete plans to increase the likelihood that plans
are implemented [ 23,25]. Intervention strategies will
promote hands-on, active learning as described by Kolb ’s
experiential learning theory. From the end of the train-
ing workshop until the end of the study period, the
intervention group will participate in ongoing technical
assistance with the study team as described above.
Evaluation for phase 2
Evaluation measures will be taken at three time points:
pre-intervention (baseline) and at 1 and 2 years
post-intervention. The study team expects that with the
presence of an in-person, customized sustainability
training curriculum will correspond with increases in
established programmatic and organizational metrics of
sustainability. Several process measures will be collected
to assess the effectiveness of the training and support
delivered. All measures will be collected via survey at
the completion of each training component or tracked
by review of programmatic records. Quantitative data
collected will be analyzed using descriptive statisticswhile qualitative analysis of programmatic records will
be conducted following the PSAT and program record
abstraction procedures. This analysis will include dosage
delivered, dosage received, and participant reactions.
Dosage delivered is the number of hours of training and
technical assistance provided to each state. Dosage re-
ceived will be measured as the extent and frequency that
state programs utilize their action plans and project re-
sources and materials. All data will be collected via an
evaluation form filled out by state program managers.
First, state programs will indicate whether or not an ac-
tion plan has been created and implemented (e.g., yes,
no). To describe frequency of use of their action plan,
state programs will provide estimates of how often pro-
gram personnel discuss and implement the action plan
(e.g., hours per month). To describe the extent of use,
state programs ’evaluations will report S.M.A.R.T. objec-
tives their stakeholder group determined at either train-
ing workshops (experimental condition) or independent
meetings (comparison condition) as well as the specific
steps this group outlined to achieve those objectives. At
each time point, programs will note which steps they
have completed under each S.M.A.R.T. objective. The
resulting ratio of complete action plan steps to incom-
plete action plan steps will represent dosage received.
This ratio measurement will allow comparisons between
state programs with action plans of different lengths.
Program managers will also indicate whether or not
their state program has utilized project resources and
materials (e.g., yes, no). They will also describe their fre-
quency of use of these resources and materials (e.g.,
daily, several times/week, several times/month, once/
month, less than once/month).
In addition, participant reactions will be measured by
the extent to which they felt that the objectives of the
training and technical assistance were achieved. They will
also be asked to report levels of satisfaction with, and their
perceptions of the usefulness of, the training and technical
assistance provided. This qualitative data will be collected
through a post-training evaluation and will inform the
study team of any limitations of the format and content as
well as ways in which the training can be improved in the
future. This feedback will assist the study team to modify
the curriculum for later dissemination.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics, including frequencies and measure
of central tendency and dispersion, will be calculated for
both the intervention and comparison groups at each of
the three data collection time points to assess baseline
averages and changes. To incorporate the influence of
each state ’s distinctive characteristics, longitudinal re-
gression analysis will be used to model the outcome forVitale et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:126 Page 9 of 12
each of the dependent variables. This analytic model is
described by the following equation:
Yit¼β0þβ1PSAT it¼0þβ2Giþβ3Ditþβ4Gi/C3Dit ðÞ
þ…þβkXk;itþuit
where Yis the outcome variable and i= state and t=t i m e
point (1 or 2); PSAT it=0is the baseline PSAT score, Gi
signifies the group (intervention or comparison), Ditsigni-
fies dosage at time t, while (G it*D it)r e p r e s e n t sa ni n t e r -
action between the group and dose terms; Xk,itrepresents
a vector of programmatic, organizational, community, and
funder variables, and uitis the error. This analysis will ul-
timately be used to test the hypothesis that the impact of
the training is nonzero and positive.
A multivariate approach accounts for the numerous in-
fluences found in programmatic, organizational, commu-
nity, and funder attributes. Additionally, data collection at
different time points allows for measuring changes in
these variables, and the influence these changes have on
institutionalization outcomes. The level of adoption and
implementation of action plans both from the training
(intervention states) and from other initiatives (compari-
son states) will vary. This variance in dosage reception
and delivery will be acknowledged through multivariate
longitudinal analysis.
Phase 3: Final dissemination strategies
The results of this study will be used in many different
ways. Potential final dissemination strategies include:
1. Electronic versions of final workbook and curriculum
materials;
2. Instructional videos to support independent action
planning work;
3. Standardized reporting forms in partnership with
the CDC-OSH to support ongoing data collection
and fidelity to the training model;
4. Technical assistance worksheets and activities posted
onwww.sustaintool.org ;
5. Webinars;
6. Findings about the impact of the program sustainability
action planning model and training curriculum on
programmatic and organizational outcomes in
high-visibility cancer, pub lic health, and dissemination
and implementation science journals and conferences;
7. All lessons learned from the training program and a
final curriculum product will be systematically
disseminated to diverse audiences, since the methods
and approaches are generalizable and adaptable to
any public health initiative.These final dissemination strategies will be provided to
both intervention and comparison state tobacco control
programs included in the study following its completion.
Additionally, the materials will be generalizable and
available for any public health program seeking to build
capacity for sustainability.
Study status
The study is currently in progress. The study team has
completed certain phase 1 activities, including an exten-
sive literature review, determination of key metrics and
variables, and development of a program record abstrac-
tion protocol. The final development of the action plan-
ning workbook and other training materials is still
ongoing and close to completion. Phase 2 of the study
has begun. Recruitment and program record abstraction
are in progress for the first round of three paired states.
Discussion
This study provides a potentially innovative approach to
increase the sustainability capacity of tobacco control pro-
grams in a number of ways. First, this study will provide
the first ever evidence-based program sustainability action
planning model and training curriculum. By establishing
this evidence-based method for action planning and tech-
nical assistance related to sustainability, the study team is
supporting state tobacco control programs and other
evidence-based public health initiatives to sustain their
positive impact, despite tumultuous funding climates.
Additionally, there are currently no available resources
specifically designed to assist state tobacco control pro-
grams in meeting national requirements to “develop a sus-
tainability plan ”or“provide measures of execution
activities as outlined in the plan ”[34]. The development
and broad dissemination of this training will assist states
to fulfill these requirements and establish their capacity to
continue sustainability planning over time. This study will
also provide more clarity on the conditions that contribute
to sustainability of evidence-based interventions, building
on existing literature focusing on effectiveness testing and
early-phase implementation.
Limitations
The study has a few limitations. The main limitation is
the possibility of state drop-out. Replacing participating
programs will be difficult due to the longitudinal nature
of the study .The study team hopes to combat this by of-
fering incentives to stay in the study, including use of ac-
tion planning resources and access to the final
dissemination products.
Staff turnover in state tobacco control programs is also
a notable concern. Discussions with tobacco control
consultants have described the seemingly unavoidable
reality of key stakeholder turnover in states. Turnover isVitale et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:126 Page 10 of 12
likely due to many factors, including lack of funding. This
is why this study is particularly timely, as there is potential
to acknowledge these hardships and create plans to im-
prove. The study team, however, will monitor staff turn-
over and manage it by staying in close contact with the
state program managers and OSH project officers.
Finally, another important limitation to note is the lack
of empirical literature related to technical assistance best
practices, particularly within tobacco control programs.
This makes it difficult to establish a uniform, evidence-
based technical assistance protocol to apply to all states.
However, through past experience of the team working
with state programs and discussions with tobacco control
consultants and a formative systematic literature review,
the study team concluded that more flexible approaches
for technical assistance may be the most efficient way to
assist states, considering that every state is unique. Thus,
the team will have technical assistance guidelines but will
employ more tailored approaches for each state, based on
need. The team hopes to gain insight on technical assist-
ance best practices and describe lessons learned in the dis-
semination products, building on the small body of
knowledge that exists for this topic area.
Conclusion
This study has the potential to improve public health pro-
grams by introducing a rigorous evaluation for program
sustainability and creating tools to improve sustainability
over time. The benefits of program sustainability will not
only benefit the state programs themselves, but also the
health of state populations through the continuation of
tobacco control initiatives shown to decrease tobacco-
related disability and death. This study ’sf i n d i n g sw i l lc o n -
tribute to the growing body of knowledge on how to
mature and sustain activities over time, thereby achieving
the full benefit of significant public health investment.
