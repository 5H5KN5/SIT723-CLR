Abstract
Background: Pancreatic cancer has one of the highest mortality rates of any malignancy, placing a substantial burden
on patients and families with high unmet informational and supportive care needs. Nevertheless, access to psychosocial
and palliative care services for the individuals affected is limi ted. There is a need for standardized approaches to facilitate
adjustment and to improve knowledge about the disease and its anticipated impact. In this intervention-development
paper guided by implementation science principles, we r eport the rationale, methods, and processes employed in
developing an interdisciplinary group psychoeducational intervention for peo ple affected by pancreatic cancer. The
acceptability and feasibility of implementation will be evaluated as a part of a subsequent feasibility study.
Methods: The Schofield and Chambers framework for designing sustainable self-management interventions in cancer
care informed the development of the intervention content and format. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation
Research served as an overarching gui de of the implementation process, including the development phase and the
formative evaluation pl an of implementation.
Results: A representative team of stakeholders collaboratively developed and tailored the intervention content and format
with attention to the principles of implementation science, including available resourcing. The final intervention prototype
was designed as a single group-session led by an interdisciplinary clinical team with expertise in caring for patients with
pancreatic cancer and their families and in addressing nu trition guidelines, disease and symptom management,
communication with family and health care providers, family im pact of cancer, preparing for the future, and palliative and
supportive care services.
Conclusions: The present paper describes the development of a gro up psychoeducational intervention to address the
informational and supportive care needs of people affected by pancreatic cancer. Consideration of implementation science
during intervention development efforts can optimize uptake a nd sustainability in the clinical setting. Our approach may be
utilized as a framework for the design and implementation of sim ilar initiatives to support people affected by diseases with
limited prognoses.

Background
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive malig-
nancies, with an overall 5-year survival rate of only 8%,
and is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death
in North America [ 1,2]. It is most often diagnosed at an
advanced and incurable stage since early symptoms are
largely absent [ 1]. The threat of impending mortality can
be highly distressing and patients affected by this disease
demonstrate higher rates of anxiety and depression than
those with other types of cancers [ 3,4]. Family members
show similar or even greater levels of distress than their
patient counterparts [ 5].
Those affected by pancreatic cancer have high informa-
tional and supportive care needs regarding symptom man-
agement, communication with health care providers
(HCPs), worry about loved ones, and uncertainty about the
future [ 6]. These needs are often unmet, despite clinical
practice guidelines calling for psychosocial and educational
support and for early palliative care [ 6–8]. This is consist-
ent with evidence that the majority of patients with ad-
vanced cancer, including those with clinically significant
psychological distress, are not referred for specialized psy-
chosocial and palliative care [ 9–12]. This gap in health care
may be related to stigma and misunderstanding about the
potential benefit of psychosocial and palliative care services
[13,14], or limited accessibility and availability [ 15].
Psychoeducation refers to a treatment modality that
provides information for self-management within a sup-
portive social context and embeds both education and
psychological care into routine care [ 16–18]. Systematic
reviews of studies with mixed cancer populations have
shown that there are significant and sustained benefits of
psychoeducational interventions in relation to emotional
distress and quality of life [ 19–21]. Psychoeducation has
often been conceptualized as an intervention for patients
with earlier stage cancer, but may be no less important for
those with advanced disease [ 8]. Multidisciplinary psy-
choeducation programs may be well-suited to address the
early information and support needs for people affected
by pancreatic cancer, yet to date, there are no targeted
psychoeducational interventions for this population.
We describe here the process of developing a psychoedu-
cational intervention to address the informational and sup-
portive care needs of people affected by pancreatic cancer,
including patients and their loved ones, following an imple-
mentation science approach. I mplementation science is an
emerging field that examines the processes by which inter-
ventions can be tailored and optimized for specific clinical
contexts [ 22]. The present paper details the development
process, which is an earlier stage of activity prior to the
conduct of a study of feasibility. By describing this process
and how it is influenced by practical and contextual factors,
we hope to provide guidance for scientists and clinicians
seeking to implement similar initiatives in their settings.Methods
We used the Schofield and Chambers [ 23]f r a m e w o r kt o
inform the development of our intervention ’s content and
format. This framework seeks to promote effective and
sustainable self-management interventions in cancer care.
It emphasizes the targeting of interventions to cancer type
and stage and tailoring them to individual needs. It also
prioritizes evidence-based content, low-intensity delivery,
and stakeholder acceptability.
We used the Consolidated Framework for Implementa-
tion Research (CFIR) as an overarching guide of the whole
implementation process [ 24]. The CFIR attends to five
main domains: (I) intervention characteristics (e.g. ,evi-
dence strength, and intervention quality and complexity);
(II) the outer setting (i.e., external factors that may affect
implementation, including the wider state of knowledge
and policy climate); (III) the inner setting (i.e., internal
organizational factors associated with readiness to imple-
ment); (IV) individual characteristics (e.g. ,personal attri-
butes of stakeholders, beliefs about intervention, self-
efficacy); and (V) the process of implementation itself,
which includes planning and forethought, engaging cham-
pions, executing the plan, and evaluating the success of the
intervention and implementation. CFIR encourages forma-
tive evaluation, which is “a rigorous assessment process de-
signed to identify potential and actual influences on the
progress and effectiveness of implementation efforts ”[25].
Such evaluation allows continuous quality improvement in
intervention content and delivery, spanning across the
phases of development and implementation.
This report conforms to the Template for Intervention
Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist, which was
developed to improve the completeness of reporting and
replicability of interventions [ 26][ s e eA d d i t i o n a lf i l e 1].

Stepwise development of the intervention
Evaluating the outer and inner setting
There has been global recognition of the importance of
integrated supportive and palliative care throughout the
illness trajectory from diagnosis to the end of life, as
reflected in recent clinical practice guidelines [ 8,27,28].
Despite such recommendations and clear clinical need,
available support services are often minimal for patients
with pancreatic cancer and their families [ 6].
The Wallace McCain Centre for Pancreatic Cancer
(WMCPC) was established in 2013 at the Princess Marga-
ret Cancer Centre (PM) in Toronto, Canada to advance
the quality of care provided for this population and to de-
velop new and innovative ways to improve outcomes and
reduce the burden of disease. The WMCPC provided a
unique opportunity to develop an improved model for the
delivery of psychosocial care as part of usual oncology
care. This center offers a comprehensive interprofessionalTong et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:80 Page 2 of 7
and multidisciplinary clinic that promotes early referral to
specialized psychosocial and palliative care services. Al-
though formulating a comprehensive treatment plan is
important to patients and their families, an early psychoe-
ducational intervention in this context could also be of
value to provide information and support and to promote
the use of such evidence-based specialized services.
Involving stakeholders
The success of the development and implementation
process of an intervention depends on the early involve-
ment of key stakeholders [ 23,24]. This ensures clinical
relevance and commitment, and engages champions
within the organization to take leadership and responsibil-
ity for sustainability. We therefore recruited an interdiscip-
linary team from the pancreatic oncology and supportive
care clinics at our comprehensive cancer center to develop
the intervention. The content developers included repre-
sentatives from nursing, an oncology clinical nurse special-
ist (CNS) ( n=1 , S M ) , s o c i a l w o r k ( n=2 , K A , A H ) ,
dietetics ( n= 1, SB), and psychology ( n= 1, CL). An expert
from patient education ( n= 1, LL) ensured that the lan-
guage and presentation of information were appropriate
for individuals with different educational backgrounds. Im-
plementation support was provided by research adminis-
tration ( n= 5 ,E T ,A R ,A D ,S C ,A F )a n dc l i n i c a l
administration ( n= 1, VK). Conceptual oversight was pro-
vided by representatives from psychology ( n=1 , G M D ) ,
psychiatry ( n= 1 ,G R ) ,p a l l i a t i v ec a r e( n=1 , C Z ) , a n d o n -
cology ( n= 1, SG). These stakeholders were involved from
the time of project conception and participated in group
and individual meetings to develop the intervention from
September 2016 to September 2017.
Assessing available resourcing
The CNS, social worker, and dietitian from our team
agreed to deliver the intervention jointly, with each tak-
ing primary responsibility for his or her area of expertise.
As part of usual care, these professionals had been pro-
viding individualized assessments and care regarding
pain and symptoms, nutrition, advance care planning,
and how to live well with pancreatic cancer. However,
they recognized the greater efficiency of a group format
and the potential value of working together to deliver
the psychoeducational intervention [ 19]. A group inter-
vention format was considered to be the most clinically
feasible and cost- and time-efficient to provide informa-
tion to patients and families. Group psychoeducational
interventions can also help normalize circumstances of
disease and reduce uncertainties of the future, by talking
to others in a similar situation [ 29], and have been used
to support both patients and caregivers affected by can-
cer [ 19,30,31]. The ongoing role of the team members
within the WMCPC would also allow the interventionto be sustained subsequently as part of routine care.
Early consultation with these professionals suggested
compatibility between their perceived clinical roles and
the goals of the intervention. As we continued to de-
velop the intervention and to conduct practice sessions,
the team became increasingly more invested in and felt
shared ownership of this implementation effort. Such
strengthening of interpersonal ties has been found to be
necessary for sustainable implementation [ 32].
There was debate during the development process about
the intervention “dose, ”or the number of sessions needed
for optimal clinical benefit. The degree of benefit people ob-
tain from psychosocial interventions is typically associated
with the number of sessions they receive [ 20], but this also
may increase the costs and burden of delivery and participa-
tion. For this reason, low-intensity designs are increasingly
adopted in stepped-care models of psychological care, to
provide services efficiently that respond to need, to improve
access and maximize cost-effectiveness [ 23,33]. This in-
cludes brief single session psychoeducational interventions,
which have shown benefits in relation to knowledge, pre-
paredness, and unmet needs, and may have greater potential
for sustainability [ 30,31]. Balancing these factors, we created
an intervention prototype consi sting of a single session last-
ing 1.5 h. The first hour focused on delivering content; the
last half hour was reserved for questions. We offered the
intervention on a rotating, biweekly basis to accommodate
space and time constraints. Thi s low-intensity model could
be integrated easily into the flow of usual care.
Establishing the evidence base for the content of the
intervention
Considerable evidence demonstrates that patients with ad-
vanced cancers experience a range of physical and psycho-
social challenges [ 7,34]. In pancreatic cancer, these
include: (1) problems with digestion and diet, poor appe-
tite, and rapid weight loss [ 35]; (2) physical symptoms such
as abdominal and back pain, nausea, jaundice, and diarrhea
[36,37]; (3) fears and concerns about the future [ 38]; and
(4) adaptation to the impact of progressive disease on self
and close others [ 39–41]. The encouragement of open
communication and partnership with the health care team
early in the disease trajectory improves symptom manage-
ment and end-of-life outcomes, and can facilitate timely
and appropriate referral and acceptance of specialized psy-
chosocial and palliative care services [ 42–44].
The experience of cancer affects not only patients, but
also their intimate others [ 45]. Family members fulfill
many important caregiving duties for their loved ones af-
fected by a cancer diagnosis, yet their roles and unique
supportive care needs are often underestimated. Without
adequate support, the burden of caregiving and worry
about losing a loved one can lead to poor health and dis-
tress [ 5,46,47], especially as the disease progresses [ 48].Tong et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:80 Page 3 of 7
Supportive interventions that treat patients and their fam-
ilies as a single group implicitly acknowledge interdepend-
encies among members of the family system [ 49], which is
consistent with the principles of palliative care [ 27].
Tailoring the intervention
We designed the intervention to welcome all interested
loved ones to attend with the patient. It was designed to
be easily comprehensible to a wide audience without over-
whelming participants with detail. The script was phrased
in plain language with a Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) score
of 65.1% [ 50] and Flesch-Kincaid reading grade level of 8.8
[51], indicating an eighth-grade reading level. The group
format and circular seating arrangement of the group
were chosen to encourage interactive discussion among
attendees and facilitators, allowing for interjections and
requests for clarification throughout the session. We in-
cluded print handouts for note-taking to reduce the bur-
den of recall. We focused on building a sense of trust and
rapport with the health care team and offered to meet for
individualized consults post-session.
Our interdisciplinary team of stakeholders reviewed the
literature to generate an initial list of topics for the inter-
vention. Upon further team consultation and refinement,
we arrived at our key content areas. They were chosen to
comprehensively address the range of concerns as identi-
fied in the literature and from clinical experience (see
Table 1for key content areas and main discussion points).
These areas were related to the physical effects of pancre-
atic cancer, its impact on psychological and social well-
being, ways to address those impacts (e.g., communication
and planning for the end of life), and resources that can
provide additional support. Generation of key content
areas was followed by the development of a treatment
manual for Living Well with Pancreatic Cancer [see Add-
itional file 2]. Participants received a folder that included
printed slides, informational pamphlets, and details about
hospital network- and community-based programs that
provide relevant support. The first author (ET) andeducation specialist (LL) assembled the PowerPoint pres-
entation and developed the accompanying script to ensure
the quality of content and design. In particular, they em-
phasized the use of plain language, readability, and devel-
oped an appropriate layout that included both text and
graphic content.
The delivery of the intervention was tailored to broach
difficult topics in a supportive and non-threatening way.
Our team acknowledged the urgency and perceived threat
of discussions of advance care planning and palliative care
for this population. Therefore, the order in which topics
were introduced was organized to commence with mater-
ial that was more practical and then to proceed to more
future-oriented topics associated with living with advanced
cancer. The intervention first addressed practical issues
involving nutrition and self-management of symptoms,
including tips on how to eat and maintain weight during
treatment, pain management, bowel movements, and how
to cope with disease and treatment-induced nausea using
both dietary and medication monitoring. This was
followed by information about palliative care and advance
care planning. To dispel myths surrounding the term pal-
liative care, we defined it as focusing on improving the
quality of life in patients and families, and including pain
and symptom management for individuals at any age or
point in the illness trajectory, regardless of the course of
treatment, aligning with recent clinical recommendations
[14,52]. We explained that adapting to advanced disease
requires engaging in and living life meaningfully, while
simultaneously planning and preparing for all eventual-
ities, including death. This challenge was described as
similar to following two, divergent paths at the same time.
This analogy of a “double road ”or“double awareness ”has
been found to be clinically useful [ 53–55].
The last issues to be discussed were the impact of can-
cer on patients and their families, and available
supportive-care services, including hospital-based ser-
vices (e.g., social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists,
spiritual care workers, mindfulness-based cognitive

therapy, psychotherapy tailored for advanced cancer
[56], and community-based services (e.g., Gilda ’s Club,
Wellspring, Canadian Cancer Society, Pancreatic Cancer
Canada, Craig ’s Cause Pancreatic Cancer Society). We
emphasized that patients and families face illness to-
gether, and discussed both the importance and difficulty
of sustaining open communication about physical, emo-
tional, and existential concerns when they arise. At-
tendees were encouraged to seek and accept help from
others. Throughout the session, we sought to engage pa-
tients and family in honest, supportive dialog as a dem-
onstration of the value of professional support [ 57].
Planning for a formative evaluation
To assess the success of our implementation effort and
to provide strategic information that may guide its fur-
ther improvement, the intervention described in this
paper is currently being tested in a feasibility study using
a mixed-methods approach. Outcomes include the rate
of referral to the intervention and number of patients
and loved ones who attend; interview feedback from at-
tendees about the timing, acceptability, and value of the
intervention, and their suggestions for its improvement;
and feedback from health care providers in the clinic
about the process and feasibility of intervention imple-
mentation. This study will aim to characterize the feasi-
bility and acceptability of the intervention and its
implementation process in an ambulatory pancreatic on-
cology clinic at a large tertiary cancer center.
Summary
We report here on the stepwise development of an
interdisciplinary-led, group psychoeducational interven-
tion to meet the informational and supportive care
needs of individuals affected by pancreatic cancer. Living
Well with Pancreatic Cancer was developed by embed-
ded health care professionals and based on their clinical
experiences, the research literature, and implementation
considerations. We hope that this paper may aid poten-
tial replication efforts and be helpful to other researchers
seeking similar endeavors. We look forward to reporting
the feasibility results when they become available.
Living with pancreatic cancer is highly challenging for
both patients and their loved ones. It may epitomize the
general public ’s worst fears about having cancer because
of its sudden onset, limited treatment options and effect-
iveness, and rapid course of deterioration. Given the
current poor rate of survival for most patients with this
disease, there is an urgent need to continue to promote
adaptation and preparation and to provide support for
patients as soon as possible after diagnosis. Living Well
with Pancreatic Cancer is consistent with guidelines to
provide early, dedicated palliative, and supportive care
concurrently with oncology care to improve the overallstandard of care [ 8]. Its implementation into routine
practice disseminates knowledge and promotes reflec-
tion about the foreseeable physical and psychosocial
concerns that arise over the course of this illness. Psy-
choeducation may constitute the first line of supportive
intervention, with more specialized individual treatment
provided subsequently within a stepped-care framework
or tiered model of supportive care delivery [ 58].
Conclusion
The present study describes the development of an
interdisciplinary-led intervention to support patients and
caregivers following a recent diagnosis of pancreatic can-
cer. We considered implementation science principles
during intervention development, to promote future up-
take and sustainability in the clinical setting. This
approach can be used to inform the design and imple-
mentation of similar initiatives to support people af-
fected by other diseases with limited prognoses.
