Abstract
Background: Menstrual health and hygiene (MHH) is a human rights issue; yet, it remains a challenge for many,
especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). MHH includes the socio-political, psychosocial, and
environmental factors that impact women ’s menstrual experiences. High proportions of girls and women in LMICs
have inadequate MHH due to limited access to menstrual knowledge, products, and stigma reinforcing harmful
myths and taboos. The aim of this pilot was to inform the design of an MHH sub-study and the implementation
and scale-up of an MHH intervention incorporated into a community-based cluster-randomized trial of integrated
sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services for youth in Zimbabwe. The objectives were to investigate (1) uptake
of a novel MHH intervention, (2) menstrual product preference, and (3) the factors that informed uptake and
product choice among young women.
Methods: Female participants aged 16 –24 years old attending the community-based SRH services between April
and July 2019 were offered the MHH intervention, which included either a menstrual cup or reusable pads,
analgesia, and MHH education. Descriptive statistics were used to quantitatively assess uptake and product choice.
Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with participants and the intervention team were used to
investigate the factors that influenced uptake and product choice.
Results: Of the 1732 eligible participants, 1414 (81.6%) took up the MHH intervention at first visit. Uptake differed
by age group with 84.6% of younger women (16 –19 years old) compared to 79.0% of older women (20 –24 years
old) taking up the intervention. There was higher uptake of reusable pads (88.0%) than menstrual cups (12.0%).
Qualitative data highlighted that internal factors, such as intervention delivery, influenced uptake. Participants noted
the importance of access to free menstrual products, analgesics, and MHH education in a youth-friendly
environment. External factors such as sociocultural factors informed product choice. Barriers to cup uptake included
fears that the cup would compromise young women ’s virginity.

Introduction
Menstruation is an issue that impacts many facets of life
such as social participation, mental and physical health,
education, and employment [ 1–3]. Globally, women and
girls face numerous challenges in managing their men-
struation. These challenges arise from cultural taboos,
lack of knowledge, limited access to safe and secure
water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, afford-
able menstrual products, appropriate disposal structures,
and pain management [ 4–6]. In 2016, the Joint Monitor-
ing Program of the World Health Organization (WHO)
and UNICEF defined adequate menstrual hygiene man-
agement as access to clean absorbents including suffi-
cient washing, drying, storage and wrapping of reusable
absorbents; adequate frequency of absorbent change;
washing the body with soap and water; adequate disposal
facilities; privacy for managing menstruation; and basic
understanding of menstruation and how to manage it
with dignity and without fear or embarrassment [ 7,8].
More recently, this has been expanded to menstrual
health and hygiene (MHH) to include the sociocultural
and economic factors that inform menstrual manage-
ment and impact women ’s lives [ 3,8].
Improving MHH will contribute to achieving the Sus-
tainable Development Goals (SGDs) on gender equality
(SDG5), good health (SDG3), education (SDG4), and clean
water and sanitation (SDG6) [ 9]. Yet, most girls and
women in low and middle-income countries (LMICs)
continue to have inadequate MHH [ 10]. Current options
for menstrual products include disposable pads and tam-
pons and cost-effective and environmentally friendly re-
usable pads, period pants, and the menstrual cup.
However, many women and girls from LMICs use inef-
fective and unhygienic menstrual materials such as cloth,
toilet paper, or old underwear [ 11]. Discomfort during
menstruation due to ineffective menstrual products and
pain relief may result in heightened anxiety, lack of confi-
dence, and absenteeism from school, work, sports, and
other socially or economically beneficial activities [ 12,13].
Moreover, lack of accurate menstrual knowledge and the
proliferation of harmful sociocultural norms can lead to
myths and taboos that also contribute to the negative
menstrual experiences of young women in LMICs [ 3].A systematic review in 2016 highlighted the potential
for interventions to improve MHH-related outcomes
among women and girls but noted a lack of evidence on
optimum models for delivery of MHH interventions [ 10].
Since then, several intervention studies have been con-
ducted in LMICs but vary in quality and focus almost ex-
clusively on girls in school [ 3]. Little is known about how
girls and young women respond to or experience non-
school, community-based MHH interventions, and which
factors inform intervention or product uptake [ 14].
The aim of this pilot study was to assess and refine the
design and implementation of a comprehensive MHH
intervention incorporated into a cluster randomized trial
of a package of integrated HIV and sexual and reproduct-
ive health (SRH) services for youth delivered in
community-based settings across Zimbabwe (the CHIE
DZA trial) (registered in clinical trials.gov :NCT03719521).
Pilot findings informed two studies: the implementation
and scale-up of the MHH intervention within the CHIE
DZA trial; and a nested longitudinal MHH sub-study in-
vestigating the acceptability, uptake, and effectiveness of
an MHH intervention on MHH knowledge, practices, and
perceptions among young women aged 16 –24 years in
Zimbabwe (Fig. 1).
The objectives were to investigate (1) the uptake of a
novel comprehensive MHH intervention, (2) menstrual
product preference, and (3) the external sociocultural,
economic, physical, and environmental factors that in-
formed intervention uptake and menstrual product choice
among young women in a community-based SRH
programme.
Methods
Study setting and participants
This study was nested within the ongoing CHIEDZA
trial that seeks to determine the impact of an integrated
community-based package of SRH and HIV services for
16–24 year olds on population-level HIV prevalence and
other health outcomes. The two-arm trial is conducted
in 24 clusters (a geographically demarcated area that in-
cludes a community centre and a primary health care
clinic) in three provinces in Zimbabwe (Harare, Ma-
shonaland East, and Bulawayo), with eight clusters perTembo et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:182 Page 2 of 12
province. Each province is stratified 1:1 to either exist-
ing, routine health services (control arm), or to receive a
package of SRH and HIV services (intervention arm).
The intervention arm services are delivered in commu-
nity centres over a 2-year period. All residents aged 16 –
24 years in the intervention clusters are eligible to access
CHIEDZA services.
In the current paper, we describe an MHH pilot study
which included female participants accessing CHIEDZA
services at the four intervention clusters in the poor and
urban settings of the Harare province.
The MHH intervention
Formative work that included a combination literature re-
view, stakeholder engagement, and qualitative focus group
discussions (FGDs), in-depth interviews, and participatory
workshops were conducted with young women (aged 16 –24
years old), community health workers (CHWs), and other
community stakeholders such as relevant community-based
organizations and the Ministry of Health and Child Care to
i n f o r ma n dd e v e l o paT h e o r yo fC h a n g e( T o C )f o rt h eM H H
intervention. Details of the for mative work will be published
elsewhere. The ToC recognizes that successful and sustain-
able MHH interventions need to address stigma and harmful
myths and taboos around me nstruation, access to MHH
education and products, and access to pain medication. The
aim of the ToC was to encapsulate how different compo-
nents of the intervention would contribute to the intended
outcomes (Fig. 2). Based on this, the MHH intervention, tobe piloted within the ongoing CHIEDZA trial, was designed
to include analgesics (paracetamol or ibuprofen), two pairs of
underwear, a bar of soap, a simp le period-tracking sheet,
comprehensive MHH education including an MHH educa-
tional pamphlet, and a choice of either a menstrual cup or
reusable pads (Fig. 3). The MHH package was provided free-
of-charge and delivered to young women within CHIEDZA
trial. The MHH intervention was delivered by an interven-
tion team that included two nurses, three community health
workers (CHWs), two youth workers, and one counsellor.
The entire intervention team went through a 2-week training
that addressed (1) youth-friendly service delivery, (2) logistics
management, (3) principles of counselling, (4) research ethics
and Good Clinical Practice, and (5) engaging young people
and other community members.
Study procedures
The pilot study was a prospective mixed-methods study
conducted from April to July 2019 in all four interven-
tion sites in Harare. In evaluating the implementation of
the pilot study, we routinely monitored uptake and
coverage data from the CHIEDZA trial and attended
weekly CHIEDZA intervention team meetings to more
fully understand the context in which the MHH inter-
vention was being conducted [ 15].
Quantitative methods
Each attendance at the CHIEDZA service is tracked in
real-time using a biometric system [ 16]. Fingerprints,Fig. 1 Framework for how the pilot informs the CHIEDZA trial and the nested MHH longitudinal sub-studyTembo et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:182 Page 3 of 12
age, and sex for each participant is recorded and
delinked from participant ’s name, birthdate, address,
or other identifying information. Additionally, the ser-
vices taken up by participants at each attendance are
recorded on electronic tablets. Data for the female
participants who accessed CHIEDZA services in the
four Harare sites were used to assess intervention up-
take and product choice. MHH intervention uptake
was calculated as the proportion of women who took
up MHH services of those who attended CHIEDZA.
Ztests were conducted to compare the proportions
reporting MHH intervention uptake and MHH prod-
uct choice disaggregated by age group.
Qualitative methods
We conducted one focus group discussion (FGD) with
the intervention team and two FGDs and four in-depth
interviews (IDIs) with female CHIEDZA participants to
explore the factors that influenced uptake of the inter-
vention and choice of menstrual product. The interven-
tion team ’s FGD included all eight team members: there
were three males (aged 24 –32 years old) and five females
(aged 24 –44 years old). The FGD explored theirunderstanding of, and attitude towards, the MHH inter-
vention, their experiences of delivering the intervention,
and their own experience of using the available products.
For the FGDs with participants, we used purposive sam-
pling to select 12 –15 women to participate in two FGDs
disaggregated by age (16 –19 and 20 –24 years old). Par-
ticipants were selected to include those who did, and did
not, take up the MHH intervention, and those who
chose the menstrual cup or reusable pads respectively.
At midline (two months into the pilot study), partici-
pants were screened (over the period of a week) by a
female research assistant (RA), informed about the
study, and asked if they were willing to be contacted via
telephone to participate in the FGDs and subsequent
IDIs. Two FGD participants from each age group were
purposively selected to represent different product
choices (two for the menstrual cup and two for the re-
usable pads), for follow-up IDIs to explore the factors
that informed menstrual product choices.
The FGDs and IDIs were conducted face-to-face by an
experienced female RA in either Shona or English (as
agreed by the participants), used semi-structured topic
guides and were audio-recorded. FGDs took 45 –60 minFig. 2 Theory of Change for the MHH InterventionTembo et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:182 Page 4 of 12
and IDIs took 30 –45 min. FGDs took place at the CHIE
DZA site outside of usual opening hours to ensure con-
fidentiality. IDIs took place at a time and place most
convenient to the participant. Written informed consent
was provided before the FGDs or IDIs were initiated.
Audio recordings of the FGDs and IDIs were then dir-
ectly transcribed into English for analysis. Data was ana-
lysed using thematic analysis based on the following broad
themes: current MHH knowledge, perceptions, and prac-
tices, facilitators and barriers to product choice, and prod-
uct user experience [ 17]. Codes were generated based on
these themes and sub-themes emerging from the tran-
scripts. All transcripts were coded manually by MT and
reviewed by a senior social scientist (JR). Themes and cod-
ing were continually reviewed and refined to capture
emerging new codes. Verbatim quotes from interview par-
ticipants were captured to highlight thematic areas and to
increase our understanding of the context.
Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed inde-
pendently and then the findings triangulated to deepen
our understanding of how the intervention was working,
how it was being received, and how it could be im-
proved. These findings were then further interrogated
during the weekly CHIEDZA intervention team meeting.
Collectively, the group would reach a consensus on anychanges or actions needed based on the evidence from
the data and their experiences.
Results
MHH intervention uptake
Of the 1732 eligible participants who sought services at
the CHIEDZA centres between April and July 2019,
1414 (81.6%) took up the MHH intervention at their first
visit. There was no evidence of a difference of uptake be-
tween the four sites. There was strong evidence for a dif-
ference in uptake by age group with 690/816 (84.6%) of
16–19 year olds compared to 724/916 (79.0%) of 20 –24
year olds accessing the MHH package ( p= 0.003).
From the qualitative data, key themes related to factors
that influenced uptake of the MHH intervention were
access to free menstrual products and analgesics, youth-
friendly intervention delivery, and access to MHH
information.
Access to free menstrual products and analgesics
Almost all participants, particularly younger women,
cited the MHH intervention as the reason behind their
initial CHIEDZA visit:
Fig. 3 MHH intervention and participant flow during the pilot studyTembo et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:182 Page 5 of 12
“I personally came here with an intention to get
pads and when I entered into the CHIEDZA booth,
I saw a very friendly service provider and felt com-
fortable and free to talk ”(FGD, 16 –19 years old).
A key motivating factor for the observed high uptake
was the provision of free reusable menstrual products,
particularly reusable pads. Most participants reported
having to use old socks or cotton wool in the absence of
the menstrual product they would prefer to use or were
able to afford before the economic downturn in
Zimbabwe:
“sometimes I would also use cloths when I didn ’t
have enough pads to last my period ”(FGD, 20 –24
years old).
Almost all participants reported that they were
“grateful ”and “happy ”that the intervention provided
them with a choice of menstrual products which
they could not afford and did not have access to be-
fore. MHH intervention team members also reported
that the free products were “the most important
hook ”for young women that accessed the CHIEDZA
services:
“…those who are coming in for menstrual hygiene,
they are going out and inviting others for menstrual
hygiene. They are only telling them that if you go to
the community you can get pads, you can get a cup
or something. They are not really raving about other
services but it ’s all about menstrual hygiene …the
communities love the products we have ”(FGD,
Nurse).
Some participants reported experiencing pain during
their menstrual periods and cited access to monthly an-
algesics as an additional reason for taking up the MHH
intervention.
Almost all participants chose to take up the MHH
intervention. Of those that did not, most only declined
uptake because their menstrual product of choice was
unavailable on the day of their visit.
Youth-friendly intervention delivery and access to MHH
information
Participants had learned about the MHH intervention in
CHIEDZA through community mobilization efforts fa-
cilitated by the intervention team:
“…we were on our way from clinic and we were told
to go to the community hall to get some pads ”
(FGD, 20 –24 years old).Once at CHIEDZA, participants reported being
“treated well ”and many found the service providers
“friendly ”and “helpful ”. MHH intervention uptake
was both a function of the provision of needed
menstrual products and youth-friendly service
provision facilitated by the delivery team. Partici-
pants highlighted how the intervention staff, unlike
their parents or teachers, provided much needed
access to MHH information in a safe, non-
judgemental environment and in a way in which
resonated with them:
“I think this is a good programme because it helps
us. Some children might have questions but they
are not able to ask their parent, they might not be
open to their parents but CHIEDZA, you are free to
ask and say things you want ”(FGD, 16 –19 years
old).
Many participants described how their only conver-
sations about menstruation began and ended at me-
narche and were limited to menstrual product use
and basic hygiene guidance. The MHH intervention
provided young women an avenue to learn more
about menstrual health from trained staff and to talk
through their MHH-related concerns and anxieties in
a safe space:
“When I entered into the booth, I saw a very
friendly service provider and felt comfortable and
free to talk and I was able to express my feelings
and to openly seek the help I needed, and I was
assisted there. Getting pads was now an extra
benefit ”(FGD, 16 –19 years old).
Participants highlighted the MHH-related education
sessions with the intervention staff. These sessions
gave participants an opportunity to feel the menstrual
products, to observe menstrual product use demon-
strations, and to openly discuss myths and taboos
around menstruation in private consultation. All the
intervention team members reported that the MHH
component of CHIEDZA was received with “grateful-
ness”and was the “most popular ”service.
Overall, both the provisio n of free menstrual prod-
ucts and youth-friendly service provision were
highlighted as key facilitators to intervention uptake.
However, older participants seemed to be more moti-
vated by the former rather than the latter as most of
them had children with them or household responsi-
bilities to get back to and thus did not have the time
to engage in the MHH-related education sessions or
other youth-friendly activities within CHIEDZA.Tembo et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:182 Page 6 of 12
Menstrual product choice among participants
Of the 1414 participants who took up the MHH inter-
vention, 1244 (88.0%) participants chose to receive the
reusable pads and the remaining 170 (12.0%) chose a
menstrual cup on their first visit. There was strong evi-
dence of a difference of product choice by age, with 50/
690 (7.2%) of 16 –19 year olds to take up the MHH inter-
vention choosing the menstrual cup versus 120/724
(16.6%) of 20 –24 year olds ( p< 0.001) (Fig. 4). The
qualitative data with clients and the intervention team
highlighted key themes related to factors that influenced
product choice :barriers and facilitators to the uptake of
menstrual cups; and barriers and facilitators to the up-
take of reusable pads.
Barriers to the uptake of menstrual cups
Sociocultural norms negatively influenced both the
delivery and the uptake of the menstrual cup among
participants. Participants reported that they and their
caregivers in the community were hesitant about
inserting the cup into their vagina. Most feared that
the cup would “take their virginity ”. Some feared that
the“big”cup would be too difficult or painful to in-
sert. Others thought the cups were stiff and hard and
feared that the cup would stretch out their vagina
making them undesirable for men to have sex with.
The FGD with the intervention team members also
highlighted these fears, and this affected their ability
to promote cup uptake, with many explaining their
struggles with delivering clear messaging to allay
these concerns:“I think it ’s also an issue of needing to look at our
cultural values. It ’s about what are we told from
childhood about virginity and inserting such big
things. So that issue is a concern and how would
you tackle it if you want to introduce a cup ”(FGD,
Community health worker).
Participants mentioned that the intervention team ap-
peared reluctant to talk about and distribute the cup,
and some expressed that they would have been willing
to trying the cup if it had been talked about during ser-
vice delivery:
“I just heard someone saying cup, but I did not
know which cup she was referring to …I got pads
instead of cup, and then I was like a cup? I did not
get it, I thought she is talking about a cup of tea. I
honestly thought that the CHIEDZA people had
been unfair, and I wanted to go back and to get a
cup”(FGD, 20 –24 years old).
Facilitators promoting the uptake of menstrual cups
The main factors that facilitated menstrual cup uptake
included anecdotal evidence of menstrual pain relief and
the prevention of leakage. Some participants chose the
cup over the reusable pad as it could be cleaned and
dried discreetly. Even though most participants chose
the reusable pads, many raised concerns over their need
to“keep [their menstruation] a secret ”, and challenges in
washing and drying their pads outside where other fam-
ily members and neighbours could see.
Fig. 4 Menstrual product choice disaggregated by age groupTembo et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:182 Page 7 of 12
The majority of participants gave negative accounts
of their menstrual experiences and often described
menstrual blood as “dirty ”or“impure ”.M a n ys p o k e
about being restricted from housework, social or reli-
g i o u sg a t h e r i n g so rs p o r t sw h i l eo t h e r se x p r e s s e d
fears of leaking or “spoiling ”their clothes leading to
being “teased ”by boys or chastised by other females
during their menstrual periods. Informed by these
negative perceptions and experiences of menstruation,
some participants chose the menstrual cup over the
reusable pads as they felt it was less likely to leak:
“The time for menstruation is so annoying because
you will be anxious and you will be afraid of spoiling
your clothes, you may not feel comfortable with a
pad, so I decided to try a cup ”(IDI, 20 –24 years old).
Others that chose to take up the menstrual cup also
cited “pain relief ”as reason for uptake:
“[Other participants] told me that period cup heals
period pains slowly. If you continue to use it you end
up not having period pains ”(FGD, 20 –24 years old).
Limited access to water in the communities and
seasonal rains also informed product choice. Some
of the participants who opted for the cup cited the
fact that it did not require much water to wash or
time to dry as reusable pads as the reason for their
choice:
“the cup is very smart, and you don ’t need to do
much washing, but you just remove it and empty it ”
(IDI, 20 –24 years old).
Barriers and facilitators promoting the uptake of reusable
pads
The main facilitators included peer influence (particu-
larly for participant ’s aged 16 –19 year olds) and the
similarity between reusable pads and disposable pads.
Participants noted that the reusable pads were most
similar to disposable pads they had used before and
therefore the less “scary ”than the cup. Many of the par-
ticipants, particularly those aged 16 –19 years old, were
encouraged to visit CHIEDZA by a classmate that had
previously visited the intervention site:
“We were in class and Rashna brought her pads and
started to show us, ‘see what they look like, and see what
they look like! ’So I said, ‘Where did you get them?' and
she said 'I got them from the community centre, on
Tuesdays. ’Today is my second time coming here, when
I came for the first time, I was given pads ”(FGD, 16 –19
years old).Overall, the few barriers to reusable pads uptake
seemed to be linked to the environmental factors that fa-
cilitated menstrual cup uptake.
Discussion
In this pilot study of a novel comprehensive MHH inter-
vention, the uptake was high. Key factors to intervention
uptake, and the SRH program more broadly, were the
availability of free menstrual products and analgesics,
youth-friendly intervention delivery, and access to tai-
lored MHH education. Most young women preferred re-
usable pads to menstrual cups. Barriers to reusable pads
uptake were limited to environmental factors such as
limited access to the amount of water needed to wash
the pads, concerns about appropriately drying pads in
the wet season and discomfort around openly drying the
pads. Highly influential facilitators to uptake of reusable
pads included peer influence amongst younger women,
the appearance of the pads, and the comfort and famil-
iarity derived from the similarity of the reusable pads to
the more well-known disposable pads. Despite anecdotal
evidence of menstrual cups reducing leakage and men-
strual pain and being easier to clean than reusable pads,
uptake was negatively informed by strong sociocultural
beliefs around the preservation of virginity, lack of pro-
motion of the cup from the intervention team, fear
around the size of the cup which was perceived to cause
vaginal stretching or pain, and/or anxiety around an in-
ability to insert it properly. This study highlights the im-
portance of context-specific interventions and informed
choice when offering MHH services to young women.
Our study findings support similar findings from other
LMICs that note that most young women face chal-
lenges in accessing menstrual products and only learn
about menstruation at menarche and even then, the in-
formation is limited and skewed by local myths and ta-
boos [ 18,19]. These barriers then lead to feelings of
isolation, shame, and fear that negatively inform how
young women experience menstruation over time [ 3].
Data on community-based MHH interventions in
LMICs is limited [ 3,20]. This study provides evidence of
the need for MHH interventions in community-based
settings. Young women want access to MHH informa-
tion, analgesics, and menstrual product choice and, if
possible, young women positively respond to these ser-
vices being delivered in youth-friendly spaces by sup-
portive and friendly staff. The principles of Behaviour
Centred Design (BCD) theory posit that behaviour
change interventions must disrupt the external environ-
ment with a “surprise ”that causes a shift in the target
individual that results in the desired change or “perform-
ance ”[21,22]. Nested within a larger SRH intervention,
the qualitative data from the pilot study suggests that
the MHH component may have been the most attractiveTembo et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:182 Page 8 of 12
service of the SRH package —effectively acting as the
“surprise “that disrupted the community environment
causing young women to come to CHIEDZA with the
prospect of being rewarded with much needed free men-
strual products, information, and support. Our hypoth-
esis is that MHH services can facilitate access to broader
SRH and HIV services within CHIEDZA. While the pilot
data does not provide quantitative evidence that other
SRH services in CHIEDZA were subsequently taken up,
we can posit that the MHH intervention increased fe-
male engagement with CHIEDZA services. We will be
able to investigate this further in the larger study. Robust
evidence for the potential “pull factor ”of MHH inter-
ventions in SRH programming could present a strong
case for the integration of MHH in SRH and HIV pro-
gramming for young women.
Reusable menstrual products are both cost-effective
and environmentally friendly. There is also anecdotal
evidence from study participants that menstrual cups re-
duce instances of leakage and period pain, particularly
from those participants that previously used tampons to
manage their periods. Despite these benefits, barriers to
menstrual cup uptake centred around sociocultural
norms that discourage insertable products due to (1)
fears of “losing virginity ”by rupturing the hymen, or (2)
fears of hurting or stretching the vagina due to the size
of the cup. Young women, particularly unmarried
women, are often discouraged from inserting products
into their vagina to preserve the hymen as a sign of one ’s
purity and virginity before marriage [ 23]. Our results
highlight that these sociocultural norms influenced, not
only, the participants but also the intervention team
members as well. Despite extensive training on men-
strual cup use, most of the intervention team members
reported to have found it difficult to promote the men-
strual cup because of their sociocultural beliefs. The te-
nets of BCD state that sustainable and effective
interventions need to consider factors outside of the be-
haviour setting as these external factors inform partici-
pant behaviour [ 21]. Our findings suggest that product
choice goes beyond provision —external environmental
factors such as access to water and sociocultural factors
in the community also play roles in the decision-making
process. With a growing body of work to scale-up use of
the menstrual cup in LMICs, understanding social and
contextual factors will prove critical to improving ac-
ceptability [ 24]. Importantly, as reflected in our findings,
intervention acceptability has to be considered and ad-
dressed from the perspective of both the participants
and the service providers [ 25].
MHH is now recognised as an important public health
issue worldwide [ 26], with an increase in MHH advocacy
and research globally [ 14,27]. Collaborative networks
such as the Menstrual Health Hub and the AfricanCoalition for Menstrual Health Management and advo-
cacy efforts such as the “MHM in Ten ”initiative, glo-
bally recognized “Menstrual Hygiene Day ”, and the
annual co-hosting of the MHM in Water, Sanitation and
Hygiene (WASH) in Schools virtual conference have all
played important roles in placing MHH at the centre of
international research and development dialogue and in
mobilizing efforts to address the MHH needs of girls
and women in LMICs [ 27–30]. However, apart from a
small feasibility study investigating menstrual practices
and perceptions around the use of the Duet (an insert-
able menstrual product) and a cup acceptability study
with 54 young women, little scientific data on MHH
needs or experiences among young women in Zimbabwe
is available [ 23,31]. A systematic review of menstrual
health interventions conducted in 2020 also highlights
limited research into the lived experiences of young
women that engage with MHH interventions in
LMICs with most of the existing data focusing on
school-based interventions and education outcomes
[14]. This pilot provides crucial MHH programming
information that has contributed to the development
and implementation of improved a multi-component
MHH intervention that aims to improve MHH know-
ledge, practices, and perceptions among young women
in Zimbabwe.
Findings from the pilot informed the following
changes to the MHH intervention within CHIEDZA (see
Fig.5):
1. Implementation of trained menstrual cup
ambassadors to increase cup promotion and
sensitization and to provide ongoing support for
new cup users
2. Procurement of smaller and softer menstrual cups
that are less intimidating to new users and are less
likely to cause discomfort or pain during insertion
3. Implementation of group-based MHH education
sessions aimed at demystifying menstruation and fa-
cilitating MHH dialogue for participants
4. Inclusion of community members such as mothers,
fathers, partners, and caregivers, in MHH
discussions
Strengths of the study were the availability of real-time
quantitative data and the use of a mixed-methods ap-
proach to gain an in-depth understanding of the various
contextual and individual factors that influenced both
the engagement of young women with MHH interven-
tion and menstrual product choice. Limitations of the
study are that data were only collected on menstrual
product uptake at single point in time and uptake does
not necessarily translate to product use. Additionally,
pilot data was collected from a fairly small sample inTembo et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:182 Page 9 of 12
poor urban settings in Harare, Zimbabwe therefore the
data may not be generalizable to all young women, such
as women in rural or high-income settings. Due to the
sensitive nature of the discussions, qualitative data col-
lection may have been informed by social desirability
bias leading to inaccurate reporting of factors informing
menstrual product choice.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate
MHH intervention uptake and product choice in a
community-based setting in an LMIC. Overall, the
pilot study results showed an unmet need for com-
prehensive MHH interventions in the community. Re-
sults also highlighted the strong influence of
sociocultural and environm ental factors on menstrual
product choice and economic factors in informing
participant engagement overall. Community-based in-
terventions should be context-specific and multicom-
ponent focused to fully address the MHH needs of
young women. Importantly, access to MHHeducation, pain management medication, and a choice
of MHH products in youth-friendly SRH program-
ming may act as facilitating factors to increase female
engagement in SRH services and improve young
women ’s SRH outcomes over time.
