ABSTRACT
Group-based interventions are widely used to promote health-related
behaviour change. While processes operating in groups have been
extensively described, it remains unclear how behaviour change isgenerated in group-based health-related behaviour-change interventions.
Understanding how such interventions facilitate change is important to
guide intervention design and process evaluations. We employed a
mixed-methods approach to identify, map and de ﬁne change processes
operating in group-based behaviour-change interventions. We reviewed
multidisciplinary literature on group dynamics, taxonomies of change
technique categories, and measures of group processes. Using weight-loss
groups as an exemplar, we also reviewed qualitative studies ofparticipants ’experiences and coded transcripts of 38 group sessions from
three weight-loss interventions. Finally, we consulted group participants,facilitators and researchers about our developing synthesis of ﬁndings.
The resulting ‘Mechanisms of Action in Group-based Interventions ’(MAGI)
framework comprises six overarching categories: (1) group interventiondesign features, (2) facilitation techniques, (3) group dynamic and
development processes, (4) inter-personal change processes, (5) selective
intra-personal change processes operating in groups, and (6) contextual
inﬂuences. The framework provides theoretical explanations of how
change occurs in group-based behaviour-change interventions and can
be applied to optimise their design and delivery, and to guide evaluation,
facilitator training and further research.ARTICLE HISTORY

2014 ) and over 100 categories of change techniques (Abraham, 2016 ; Abraham & Michie, 2008 ;
Michie et al., 2013 ) have been identi ﬁed, some for speci ﬁc intervention types including those target-
ing diet and physical activity (Michie, Churchill, & West, 2011 ), weight loss (Hartmann-Boyce, Aveyard,
Koshiaris, & Jebb, 2016 ), smoking cessation (West, Walia, Hyder, Shahab, & Michie, 2010 ), and gam-
bling problems (Rodda et al., 2018 ). Moreover, evidence on which types of techniques are associated
with improved intervention e ﬀectiveness is accumulating (e.g., Dombrowski et al., 2012 ; Hartmann-
Boyce, Johns, Jebb, & Aveyard, 2014 ; Michie, Abraham, Whittington, McAteer, & Gupta, 2009 ; Tang,
Abraham, & Greaves, 2016 ). However, to date most research into change processes and change tech-
niques has focused on individual-level, intra-personal change.
Group-based interventions are widely used to p romote health and to support health-related
behaviour change. Systematic reviews show that such interventions can be e ﬀective, for
example, in increasing physical activity (Hanson & Jones, 2015;H a r d e ne ta l . , 2015), supporting
weight loss (Borek, Abraham, Greaves, & Tarrant, 2018) and smoking cessation (Stead, Carroll, &
Lancaster, 2017;W e s te ta l . ,2010), and improving self-management of type 2 diabetes
(Odgers-Jewell et al., 2017), cancer (Smith-Turchyn, Morgan, & Richardson, 2016)a n do t h e r
chronic conditions (Foster, T aylor, Eldridge, Ramsay, & Gri ﬃths,2007 ). For example, a meta-analy-
sis of 24 group-based weight-loss interventions showed a mean diﬀ erence in weight loss between
control and intervention groups of −3.44 kg (95% CI [ −4.23,−2.85]; p< .001) at 12 months (Borek
et al., 2018 ).
The use of groups to deliver behaviour-change interventions is further routinely justi ﬁed on
the basis of time- and resource-e ﬃciency, the opportunity for interaction between members
and provision of social support (Borek & Abraham, 2018 ; Greaves & Campbell, 2007). It is also
assumed that group members ’interactions with each other and wi th facilitators can generate per-
sonal change that persists beyond the life of the group. This assumption is supported by decades
of research suggesting that group membership can change members ’p erceptions, cognitions
and behaviours (e.g., Brown, 1993; Cartwright & Zander, 1968; Smith, 1980). For example, the
importance of group identi ﬁcation (or ‘group spirit ’) and social support was proposed as far
back as 1905 in psychotherapy groups for tu berculosis patients (Horne & Rosenthal, 1997). Con-
siderable subsequent work has focused on the role of social identi ﬁcation in groups and how
s o c i a lg r o u pm e m b e r s h i p( a n d group interventions speci ﬁcally) may in ﬂuence health outcomes
(e.g., Haslam, Cruwys, Haslam, Dingle, & Chang, 2016;J e t t e n ,H a s l a m ,&H a s l a m ,2012 ;T a j f e l&
Turner, 1979). Interpersonal change pro cesses in health-related groups have also been described,
including social comparisons and social validation (Abraham & Gardner, 2009 ), and group support
and communicating group member identities (West et al., 2010). Furthermore, individual-level
change processes that have been widely researched may be targeted in group-based interven-
tions, for example, normative belief change, atti tude change, goal setting, goal review and feed-
back that bolsters self-e ﬃcacy. It is unclear, however, how such individual-level change processes
and techniques operate in groups and how individual change is in ﬂuenced by the group context.
There is wide variation in the design and delivery of health-related group-based behaviour-
change interventions (GB-BCIs), and a wide heterogeneity in their e ﬀectiveness. For example, in
a meta-analysis of weight-loss groups at 12 months, some studies showed average weight lossdiﬀerences (between intervention and contro l groups) of 0-1 kg while others showed di ﬀerences
of up to 9.6 kg (Borek et al., 2018). This pattern of eﬀ ective and ine ﬀective outcomes, following
group-based interventions de signed to promote the same types of behaviour change, indicates
a lack of understanding of, and consensus concerning, how group-based interventions work
and, consequently, how they should be designed and delivered to maximise e ﬀectiveness. Avail-
able research does not provide integrated mode ls of change processes or a basis for guidance on
GB-BCI design and implementation. An integrativ e framework of key group features and interper-
sonal change processes operating in such groups , as well as types of change techniques that can
facilitate behaviour change among group members , would therefore have considerable potential
to improve the design and implementation of health-related GB-BCIs.228 A. J. BOREK ET AL.
Research questions
We aimed to develop an integrative framework of group features and interpersonal change pro-
cesses operating in GB-BCIs by synthesising current knowledge about groups in the ﬁelds of
group dynamics and behaviour change research. Our research question was: what elementsrelated to the design, delivery, context and change processes in groups may help explain how
changes in individual behaviour and health outcomes are generated by GB-BCIs? We de ﬁned a
group-based intervention as an intervention partly or fully delivered in groups, that is, when at
least three people are present, interact with each other and recognise their roles as group
members (or group intervention participants), and at least one other person adopts the role of facil-
itator and is acknowledged to hold that role. We focused on face-to-face adult groups that targethealth-related behaviour changes, using the example of diet and physical activity behaviour-
change interventions to promote weight loss and prevention of weight-related conditions (e.g.,
type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease).
Methods
We used a mixed-method approach focusing on theoretical integration of data gathered in threesteps from: (1) literature reviews, (2) qualitative content analysis of audio-recorded GB-BCI sessions
and intervention manuals, and (3) expert consultations. We started with identifying and de ﬁning
(based on relevant literature) key terms, such as a group and mechanisms of action, and these
were re ﬁned as the study progressed ( Table 1 ). We followed methodological guidance from Carroll
et al. drawing on the ‘best ﬁt’approach to framework synthesis (Carroll, Booth, Leaviss, & Rick,
2013 ). We began with an ‘a priori framework ’in the form of a parsimonious model of group operation
from a previous conceptual overview (Borek & Abraham, 2018 ). Novel, potentially relevant categories
(i.e., group characteristics, change processes, technique categories or targets) were identi ﬁed in the
literature reviews and qualitative coding. The study team members, drawing on their experience ofGB-BCI design, delivery and evaluation, and their knowledge of social psychological research on
groups, discussed all candidate categories and agreed on whether to add them to the framework
or incorporate them within existing ones. Through this process we also identi ﬁed higher-level, over-
arching categories, and deﬁ ned all categories and hypothesised relationships between them.
Throughout the study, we also consulted with di ﬀerent experts outside of the study team (including
group facilitators, participants and researchers) who also made suggestions for candidate categories,helped us to describe processes and techniques already included in draft versions of the framework
and provided examples of these. This was an iterative process and the framework was revised after
each step, and in response to feedback from experts. Categories identi ﬁed in each of these steps are
listed in Supplementary Document 1. Di ﬀerent versions of the evolving framework, following each
step of the development and expert consultations, as well as further details of the methods outlinedbelow, are provided in the technical report (Borek et al., In Press ).
Literature reviews
We identi ﬁed and reviewed the literature on change processes in groups, including (i) theoretical lit-
erature on group dynamics and personal change in groups, (ii) existing taxonomies of categories of
change techniques, (iii) measures of group processes, and (iv) qualitative studies of participants ’
experiences of weight-loss groups.
Theoretical literature on group processes
We built on earlier reviews, including a previous conceptual overview of change processes in GB-BCIs
(Borek & Abraham, 2018 ), guidelines on reporting of GB-BCIs (Borek, Abraham, Smith, Greaves, &
Tarrant, 2015 ) and an earlier framework for design and delivery of group interventions (Hoddinott,HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 229
Allan, Avenell, & Britten, 2010 ). We began with ﬁve overarching categories derived from Borek and
Abraham ’s(2018 ) review. These constituted our a priori framework. They were: (1) group develop-
ment processes, (2) dynamic group processes and properties, (3) social change processes, (4) personal
change processes, and (5) group design and operating parameters. In parallel, we tried to encompassin the framework three categories deﬁ ned in the UK Medical Research Council guidance on conduct-
ing process evaluation to understand the functioning of complex interventions (Moore et al., 2014 ):
implementation (i.e., delivery methods and techniques used), mechanisms of impact (i.e., groupdynamics and processes of change), and context (i.e., facilitator and participant characteristics and
wider contextual inﬂ uences).
We then reviewed reviews of group processes and individual change in groups (e.g., Association
for Specialists in Group Work, 2000 ; Brown, 1993 ; Horne & Rosenthal, 1997 ; Jaques & Salmon, 2007 ;
Johnson & Johnson, 1991 ; Knowles & Knowles, 1972 ; McGrath, Arrow, & Berdahl, 2000 ; Smith, 1980 ;
Yalom & Leszcz, 2005 ) and identi ﬁed change techniques and facilitation strategies (related toTable 1. Deﬁnitions of key terms used in the study.
Key terms De ﬁnitions
Interventions Interventions, programmes or treatments that aim to facilitate individual health-related change
processes, and thus improve health or prevent illness.
Behaviour-change
interventionsInterventions that aim to bring about changes in individual behaviours.
Modes of delivery Overall approach to how an intervention is delivered, such as, through one-to-one consultations,
groups, self-delivery (e.g., manuals, apps or websites), in person or online.
Group At least three people who interact with each other and acknowledge their roles as group members.
Group-based interventions Interventions partly or fully delivered in groups, that is, when at least three people are present,
interact with each other and recognise their roles as group members (or participants), and at least
one other person adopts the role of facilitator and is acknowledged to hold that role.
Mechanisms of action All change processes and techniques, and interactions between them, that in ﬂuence how a health
behaviour-change intervention works and that may a ﬀect intervention outcomes. The mechanisms
of action of GB-BCIs identi ﬁed in this study include group dynamics, intra- and inter-personal
change processes and facilitation techniques (framework categories 2-5) and interactions betweenthem (as illustrated in Figure 1).
These are underpinned by group design features (framework category 1) and are in ﬂuenced by
other factors external to the group/intervention (e.g., facilitator and participant characteristics, andwider contextual factors).
Change processes Processes that are theorised to a ﬀect individual psychological and/or behaviour change. Such
processes may instigate and facilitate or impede change. They may be inter- orintra- personal.
Inter-personal change
processesChange processes that are instigated through interaction with, or presence of, one or more other
people (e.g., social validation, social comparison processes). These are included in the frameworkas category ‘4. Inter-personal change processes ’.
Intra-personal change
processesChange processes that occur within individuals to bring about individual psychological and/or
behaviour change (e.g., changes in self-e ﬃcacy). These are included in the framework as category ‘5.
Intra-personal change processes & targets ’.
Facilitation techniques Any action taken, or technique used, by group intervention facilitators to deliver the intervention,
facilitate the group and group interaction, and facilitate change processes. These include changetechniques (see below) or more generic facilitation techniques to manage interaction and groupdynamics (e.g., facilitating group discussion, prompting individual introductions in groups). Theseare included in the framework as category ‘2. Facilitation techniques ’.
Change techniques Actions taken, or techniques used, by group intervention facilitators speci ﬁcally to instigate or
support inter- and intra-personal change processes .
For example, a change technique ‘provide opportunities for social comparisons’ may support inter-
personal change process ‘social comparisons’ , whereas a technique ‘facilitate progress review ’may
support intra-personal change process ‘reviewing progress, goals ’. These are included in the
framework as categories ‘2.4. Techniques to facilitate inter-personal change processes ’and ‘2.5.
Techniques to facilitate intra-personal change processes ’.
Although
these are commonly referred to as ‘behaviour change techniques ’, we refer to them as
‘change techniques ’because they usually initially instigate psychological change that may or may
not lead to behaviour change. For example, ‘providing individual-level feedback ’initially prompts
an intra-personal change in individual cognition that may/may not lead to change in behaviourpatterns. When we refer to change techniques we really mean a set of categories or types of
techniques because each technique can take di ﬀerent forms and be delivered di ﬀerently.230 A. J. BOREK ET AL.
implementation), change processes (or mechanisms of action), and elements of group design and
contextual factors, and compared these with the categories in the a priori framework.
Taxonomies categorising change techniques
We selected and reviewed six widely-used taxonomies of categories of change techniques. We will,hereafter, use the term ‘change technique ’as shorthand for a de ﬁned category of potentially-
eﬀective actions or practices assumed to inﬂ uence a speci ﬁed change mechanism which may or
may not be e ﬀective in prompting psychological and/or behaviour change (Abraham, 2016 ). They
were: (i) a theoretically-linked list of 23 frequently-used change techniques (Abraham & Michie,2008 ), (ii) the CALO-RE taxonomy for diet and physical activity interventions (Michie et al., 2011 ),
(iii) the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1) (Abraham et al., 2015 ; Michie et al.,
2013 ), (iv) the Intervention Mapping taxonomy (Kok et al., 2015 ), (v) the Oxford Food and Activity
Behaviors (OxFAB) taxonomy of techniques used by participants for weight loss (Hartmann-Boyce
et al., 2016 ), and (vi) a taxonomy of group-speci ﬁc techniques used in smoking cessation programmes
(West et al., 2010 ). From these, we identi ﬁed change techniques that are group-speci ﬁc(i.e., unique to
groups or particularly suitable to group delivery due to being dependent on inter-personal inter-action) and group-sensitive (i.e., which operate at an intra-personal level but may be adapted to, or
aﬀected by, group delivery). Initially, the ﬁrst author identi ﬁed potentially relevant change tech-
niques. Then, the ﬁrst and second authors reviewed each taxonomy together and discussed all tech-
niques, comparing them with, and where relevant adding novel concepts to, the mechanisms
identi ﬁed in the developing framework.
Measures of group processes
Through electronic searches and personal communication with other researchers working on groups,we identi ﬁed three reviews of measures of intra-group processes (Cahill et al., 2008 ; Delucia-Waack,
1997 ; Orfanos, 2015 ), and other reviews of potentially relevant measures (Bales, 1950 ; Beck & Lewis,
2000 ; Chapman, Baker, Porter, Thayer, & Burlingame, 2010 ; Estabrooks & Carron, 2000 ; Kiesler, 2004 ;
Lee, Koopman, Hollenbeck, Wang, & Lanaj, 2015 ; Roter & Larson, 2002 ; Tate, Rivera, Conwill, Miller, &
Puig, 2013 ; Wilson et al., 2008 ; Wölfer, Faber, & Hewstone, 2015 ).
From these reviews four types of measures were identi ﬁed: (i) screening tools to assess partici-
pants ’suitability for, or ﬁt with, the group; (ii) measures to assess group facilitators ’skills and beha-
viours; (iii) tools to analyse and assess group interaction; and (iv) questionnaires designed for group

participants to assess perceptions of group characteristics, climate and processes. We listed measures
(Supplementary Document 3) and added novel mechanisms and concepts identi ﬁed therein to the
developing framework.
Qualitative studies of participants ’experiences of groups
We reviewed qualitative studies of participants ’perceptions and experiences of group-based inter-
ventions, focusing on interventions supporting weight loss in overweight or obese adults. Wesearched electronic databases (Medline, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Embase, Social Policy and Practiceaccessed via Ovid platform) between 2000 and June 2016 using a detailed search strategy (Sup-
plementary Document 2) and screened over 4000 identi ﬁed references. Twenty-seven studies
were included and uploaded to NVivo where they were thematically coded to identify categories
that were compared with and, where relevant, added to the developing framework. (For details
see Supplementary Document 2). Common themes included factors related to individuals (e.g., pre-
vious experiences of weight loss), group design (e.g., contact time, venue), facilitators (e.g., personaland professional qualities), group context (e.g., group climate), change processes (e.g., accountability
to the group, peer pressure), aspects of practical delivery, and content of group sessions (e.g., group
activities and topics).
Qualitative content analysis of recorded group sessions and intervention manuals
We analysed group session recordings from three GB-BCIs targeting changes in diet and physicalactivity to support weight loss and its maintenance: (i) the ‘Living Well Taking Control ’(LWTC) pro-
gramme ( www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN702216700 ; Kok et al., 2016 ; Smith et al., under review ), (ii) the
‘Skills for weight loss Maintenance ’(SkiM) intervention ( www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN45134679 ), and (iii)
the‘Waste the Waist ’(WtW) intervention ( www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN10707899 ; Gillison et al., 2012 ,
2015 ; Greaves et al., 2015 ). The three interventions were selected as a starting point for this work
because (a) they all targeted the same behaviour change objectives; (b) they were all systematicallydesigned employing recent psychological and behavioural science evidence and, therefore, providedexamples of contemporary applications of behaviour change theory and techniques to alter speci ﬁed
behavioural targets; and (c) pragmatically, because the authors had access to the data from theseinterventions. Ethics approvals were in place for these three studies, including participant consentfor audio-recording and analysis of the group sessions. All three interventions were based on avail-
able intervention delivery manuals, and were delivered in small groups (up to 15 participants) in com-
munity venues by trained facilitators with backgrounds in health promotion, diet or physical activity.Each involved a range of recognised change techniques delivered using a mixture of interactive
group discussions, activities, provision of information about healthy diet, physical activity and
weight loss, and self-monitoring diaries. For details about the interventions see Supplementary Docu-ment 4.
Session recordings were sampled using a purposeful strategy to maximise the diversity of tran-
scripts (see below; for details of which sessions were sampled in each stage of analysis, see Sup-plementary Document 5). The recordings were transcribed verbatim, including audible non-verbal
behaviours, such as laughter. The transcripts were checked for accuracy with recordings and
uploaded to NVivo (v10/11) where they were organised to support analysis.
In the ﬁrst stage, we purposively sampled 10 audio recordings of group sessions from the three
interventions to ensure diversity across intervention stages (beginning, middle and ﬁnal sessions)
and facilitators. The sample included four sessions from the LWTC programme (with two di ﬀerent
facilitators), two sessions from SkiM (with one facilitator) and four sessions from WtW (with ﬁve
diﬀerent co-facilitators). The ﬁrst author then coded the transcripts, taking as much of an inductive
approach as possible (i.e., working up from the data). The coding involved applying codes (orlabels) to parts of transcripts that represented di ﬀerent types of group interaction, or, in other232 A. J. BOREK ET AL.
words, to capture what happened in the group, including examples of group activities, group pro-
cesses and facilitation techniques.
In the second stage, we selected (sampling to ensure diversity of groups, session numbers and
facilitators) an additional 28 transcripts from LWTC ( n= 12) and SkiM ( n= 16). Remaining recordings
of WtW sessions were of insu ﬃcient quality and could not be included. In this stage we deductively
coded the transcripts using a draft MAGI framework. To enable more reliable coding and double-
coding, based on the evolving deﬁ nitions of concepts included in the framework, we drafted
coding instructions for all framework categories. The ﬁrst author coded all the transcripts, and six
transcripts were independently double-coded by four co-authors and one external researcherusing the draft coding instructions. After the double-coding, the instructions and draft framework
were revised to capture any new categories identi ﬁed, improve the de ﬁnitions and make the
coding instructions more precise. The ﬁnal coding instructions are available in Supplementary Docu-
ment 6 and more details of these qualitative analyses are provided in the technical study report(Borek et al., In Press ).
In addition to analysing transcripts of recordings of group sessions, we selected the primary inter-
vention manual used to deliver group sessions from each of the three interventions and uploadedthem to NVivo (v10/11). We coded the content of the manuals, identifying sections of text relatedto group delivery, such as instructions for group facilitation (e.g., facilitation style, group activities),
and change techniques (e.g., goal setting). The codes were then compared to our developing
framework.
To supplement the qualitative analyses of session transcripts and delivery manuals, the ﬁrst author
observed eight LWTC sessions from three di ﬀerent groups and the third author observed three SkiM
sessions (all delivered around Exeter, UK). Field notes were kept and referred to but not formally ana-lysed. These observations shaped our interpretation of how participants interacted with each other
and the facilitator and highlighted potentially-important GB-BCI characteristics and processes that
cannot be identi ﬁed in audio recordings of group sessions (e.g., room set-up, non-verbal behaviour).
Expert consultations
Throughout the research, we sought expert input and feedback on the evolving framework from
other researchers working with GB-BCIs, group facilitators and group participants. In the early
stages, we consulted with two group participants from the LWTC programme and with two groupfacilitators from the LWTC and SkiM interventions. In the ﬁnal stage of the research, we consulted
with four LWTC participants and four group facilitators (LWTC and SkiM). Throughout the research,we sought feedback from researchers and practitioners at relevant conferences, a departmentalseminar and by running a workshop at a national conference. We also sought feedback from 12
researchers and practitioners external to the research team with backgrounds in health behaviour
change and group interventions who had agreed to be contacted, of whom seven provided detailedwritten comments on the near- ﬁnal version of the framework. We asked these experts how groups
might facilitate or impede behaviour changes and health outcomes, what the important processesand facilitation strategies in groups might be, and about bene ﬁts and challenges of delivering inter-
ventions in groups. We also asked them to comment on, and suggest improvements to, the frame-
work. Feedback informed extension, revision and re ﬁnement of the developing framework.
Results
Concepts identi ﬁed as important to the operation of groups were grouped into six overarching cat-
egories: (1) group intervention design, (2) facilitation techniques, (3) group dynamics and develop-ment, (4) inter-personal change processes, (5) intra-personal change processes and targets, and (6)
facilitator and participant characteristics and wider contextual inﬂ uences. The deﬁ nitions of the
key terms are reported in Table 1 . The structure of the framework, and relationships between theHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 233
categories, are illustrated in Figure 1 and speci ﬁc elements in the six categories are presented in Table
2. Supplementary Document 7 includes detailed de ﬁnitions and examples of the framework cat-
egories, and hypothesised processes by which they may inﬂ uence each other. Each of the categories,
and key elements within them are described in turn below.
Group intervention design
These are features of GB-BCI design that may a ﬀect the functioning of the group and the delivery and
receipt of intended change processes. Group intervention design features identi ﬁed included (1.1)
intended processes and outcomes of the intervention (as would be speci ﬁed in an intervention logic
model), and the (1.2) purpose and bene ﬁts of using a group format . For example, if peer support is
deemed an important basis for using a group format, facilitation techniques that promote peer
support processes could be planned, rather than expecting such support to occur spontaneously.Table 2. Mechanisms of action in group-based interventions (MAGI) framework.

Pre-speci ﬁed (1.3) group characteristics (e.g., group size) and (1.4) participant selection and group
composition , including participants ’demographic (e.g., age, gender) and condition-related (e.g.,
risk of diabetes) characteristics and attendance of any accompanying persons (e.g., partners), may
aﬀect interactions, and so alter operating change processes. For example, group size may a ﬀect pat-
terns of interaction between members, whereas sharing certain characteristics may promote social
identi ﬁcation and social comparison processes.
(1.5) Facilitator selection , especially facilitators ’professional and personal skills, and training, may
aﬀectﬁdelity and quality of delivery and interaction patterns in the group so determining which
change processes operate. For example, facilitators whom participants consider to be credible
sources, with whom they identify (e.g., peers), and who have good inter-personal skills may be
more able to instigate group identi ﬁcation and social inﬂ uence processes.
(1.6) Intervention content , including participant and facilitator materials, session content, group
activities, between-session tasks and any additional resources (e.g., extra classes, access to facilities),as well as contacts outside the group (e.g., additional one-to-one counselling) were identi ﬁed as part
of intervention design. The (1.7) setting and venue (e.g., room size, comfort, accessibility; community
versus hospital settings) are also likely to shape participants’ expectations and experiences of the
program. Finally, (1.8) group set-up and delivery design elements include decisions about the
contact time, and the intended facilitation style that will be used to generate planned change pro-
cesses. Considering and planning these elements during intervention design is likely to optimise
group dynamics and development that are conducive to the pursuit of group goals, and nurtureplanned change processes.
Facilitation techniques
These are used by group facilitators to deliver sessions, facilitate group dynamics, and initiateplanned change processes. (2.1) Setting up the group or starting the sessions (emphasised by the tri-
angles in Figure 1 ) may help establish an interpersonal context conducive to inducing inter- and intra-
personal change processes. Starting sessions in on-going, open groups may di ﬀer to starting sessions
in time-bound, closed groups, which has implications for the design of group activities and content.For example, in open groups personal introductions may be repeated at the beginning of every
session, whereas in closed groups they may be completed at the start of the ﬁrst session only.
Throughout the lifespan of the group, facilitators may have di ﬀerent tasks requiring di ﬀerent types
of facilitation techniques. For example, they shape group interaction and activities, deliver interven-tion content and facilitate positive, while managing any negative, group processes. We identi ﬁed a
range of facilitation techniques to ful ﬁl these tasks, which we categorised as: (2.2) generic techniques
to facilitate group interaction and engagement; (2.3) techniques to facilitate positive group dynamics
and development ; (2.4) techniques to facilitate inter-personal change processes ; and (2.5) techniques to
prompt intra-personal change processes. These facilitation techniques might change or be adapted
over time depending on emerging group dynamics and change processes, the needs and character-
istics of the group and participants and their progress in achieving goals and intervention outcomes
(hence two-way arrows in Figure 1 ).
Finally, we also identi ﬁed (2.6) techniques for closing the group or session . These may help reinforce
participants ’commitment to change and to return to the next session. Although some of these
‘closing ’techniques might be delivered throughout the intervention, the use of such techniques at
the end of the group or session may be useful in reinforcing messages about the initiation and main-
tenance of change. Examples of these di ﬀerent types of facilitation techniques are in Table 3 .
Group dynamic and development processes
Group dynamics are emerging and changeable processes and properties used to describe how small
groups work (i.e., how individuals function as a group), and group development describes howHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 235
groups change over time (i.e., represented by the arrow in Figure 1 ). These processes are unique to a
group setting and are relevant to di ﬀerent types of groups, regardless of whether they target per-
sonal change. Successful development of positive group dynamics and progression into a cohesive,
collaborative group working towards common goals may help create a social environment that pro-
motes change processes. Conversely, negative group dynamics or impeded development may inhibitchange processes and negatively a ﬀect participants ’experiences of the group, increasing the likeli-
hood of low attendance and drop out. Therefore, group dynamics and development may be concep-tualised as underpinning change processes in groups. Group dynamics can be in ﬂuenced by
facilitation techniques, facilitator and participant characteristics (and the relationship and interaction
between them), and by contextual in ﬂuences (e.g., wider social norms). These inﬂ uences on group
dynamics can be planned (e.g., selection of facilitation techniques) or unplanned and speci ﬁct o
the group (e.g., personalities of group members).
Table 2 lists the types of group dynamic processes and properties identi ﬁed in this study. For a
group of individuals to become a ‘group ’, they may need to develop or identify (3.1) group goal(s).Table 3. Examples of di ﬀerent types of facilitation techniques.

This might involve a common purpose or task for the group (e.g., organising a health-related event),
or individual goals that group members have in common and work towards (e.g., losing weight). (3.2)Identi ﬁcation with or as a group , that is developing a perception that a number of people constitute a
group and are group members (i.e., self-de ﬁning as a group), is another process that underlies
forming a group. Group goals and identi ﬁcation may contribute to development of (3.3) group cohe-
sion and attractiveness (i.e., bonds that members have with the group and each other). Stronger cohe-
sion and perception of attractiveness of the group to its members (e.g., that it ful ﬁls their needs and
goals) can a ﬀect members wanting to belong to, and remain in, the group.
Moreover, group dynamics include: (3.4) group climate (i.e., a socio-emotional context or group
atmosphere); (3.5) group engagement (how actively members participate in the group); (3.6) com-
munication patterns (how participants communicate with each other and with the facilitators, and
how co-facilitators interact); (3.7) group norms which include explicit and implicit rules about accep-
table and unacceptable behaviour in the group; (3.8) group roles which refer to members ’formal and
informal functions and responsibilities within the group (e.g., formal –a facilitator, a treasurer; infor-
mal–a joker, debater). Finally, (3.9) group development refers to how a group itself may change over
time. Among many models and theories on how groups change, commonly groups are thought tomove through the stages of forming, storming (insecurities, tensions), norming (establishingpatters and relations), performing (working towards group goals) and (often) adjourning (Tuckman
& Jensen, 1977 ).
These group dynamic and development properties and processes are interactive and may have
reciprocal e ﬀects. For example, identifying with the group may help identify a common group
goal and create a sense of group cohesion, whereas group cohesion may be measured through a
sense of identi ﬁcation with the group and perceptions of common group goals. Such group dynamics
occur in any types of groups and they emerge regardless of the facilitator ’s actions. However, facil-
itators can actively promote positive group dynamics, for example, through identifying and agreeingon group rules for working together, and helping resolve any con ﬂicts or tensions.
Inter-personal change processes
These are change processes that are instigated and operate in social contexts and through social (or
group) interactions. They are unique to, or reinforced by, the group context. They can be in ﬂuenced
by group dynamics, such as establishment of a common goal, a sense of group identi ﬁcation and
cohesion, and con ﬁdential and supportive group climate.
Many behaviour-change groups are interactive groups, in which participants (4.1) share experi-
ences and have an opportunity to learn from each other (4.2. social learning ) by exchanging infor-
mation, advice and ideas (through group discussions), and by modelling or vicarious learning (e.g.,through group activities). Group interaction can also be a source of (4.3) social in ﬂuence whereby par-
ticipants in ﬂuence each other ’s beliefs or behaviours, for example, by referring to personal experi-
ences and expertise, using health-promoting or ‘resistant’ talk, exerting persuasion or providing
encouragement or pressure. Participants may also inﬂ uence each other directly through (4.4) agree-
ing or disagreeing with, or challenging , each other.
Many health-related groups o ﬀer opportunities for (4.5) social support in the group, which can
involve informational (e.g., exchange of information), emotional (e.g., encouragement) or practical
support (e.g., buddying up to do something together). As part of social support processes, groupsmay also provide opportunities for making new social connections (thus, they may help reduce iso-
lation and develop a support network) and for providing support to others (thus, capitalising on
beneﬁts of reciprocity). Groups can also provide opportunities for (4.6) social validation of, or normal-
ising, participants’ experiences, and helping them realise that they are not alone with a problem or
challenge, which can reinforce self-e ﬃcacy and self-esteem.
Change may be facilitated through (4.7) social identi ﬁcation with others who are perceived as
belonging to similar social groups or categories. This may involve recognition of pre-establishedHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 237
shared identities (from outside the group) and/or development of a new group identity among
members. Change might be particularly reinforced if group member identities promote health-related social norms and behaviours. Conversely, health-impeding identities may need to be explored
and re-de ﬁned in the group in ways that can bolster behaviour change. Being in a group may also
create opportunities for upward and downward (4.8) social comparisons (including identifying or
becoming role models) and for feeling (4.9) accountable to the group for achieving individual or
group goals, which might motivate participants to take action. Similarly, (4.10) competition might
be a source of motivation to improve performance, either compared to others in a group (intra-
group competition) or to other groups (inter-group competition). Participants may equally (4.11)
cooperate by working together to achieve group or individual goals.
Change can also be instigated and reinforced by collaborative (4.12) group problem solving (i.e.,
involving group members discussing common ‘problems ’or challenges and identifying possible sol-
utions), and by providing (4.13) feedback to the group on the group performance (which may
reinforce common group goals and cooperation). Finally, being in a group might prompt (4.14)
social facilitation , whereby people ’s performance on simple or well-trained tasks may improve,
whereas the performance of less established, complex skills may be undermined, by being in thepresence of others.
Intra-personal change processes and targets
Intra-personal change processes and psychological targets (e.g., beliefs) operate within individuals
and can be instigated without a group. When generated in a group, intra-personal change processesmay be a ﬀected or prompted by inter-personal processes, or they may occur simultaneously. Both
these types of change processes may be also a ﬀected by the group dynamics and development, facil-
itator techniques, facilitator and participant characteristics, and the wider socio-cultural contextwithin which the group operates (as illustrated in Figure 1 ). Moreover, intra-personal change pro-
cesses may, and should for longer-term e ﬀects, extend beyond the group (as represented by the
darker arrow extending beyond the lighter ‘group dynamics ’arrow in Figure 1 ). Here we report
selected examples of intra-personal change processes that are particularly common in, and adaptableto, group-based delivery.
Group sessions require considerable time and eﬀ ort so participants need to (5.1) commit to attend
the group . In the group, participants can (5.2) develop and express understanding (or lack of under-
standing), which can be facilitated by social learning processes. Interacting in a group, participants
may (5.3) self-present themselves in an intentional way (e.g., as health-oriented) and express their
health-related (5.4) normative beliefs , (5.5) attitudes , (5.6) attributions , (5.8) expectations of interventions
outcomes , (5.9) motivation , or (5.10) self-eﬃcacy and sense of personal control (or lack thereof). They
may express, discuss and acknowledge changes in these targets, which, in turn, can be a ﬀected by
the group and others ’expressions. Moreover, if the expressed beliefs or attitudes are di ﬀerent
from participants ’behaviour patterns, the resultant (5.7) cognitive dissonance could prompt change
in motivation and behaviour to reduce the inconsistency. Group interaction and sharing can also
help develop (5.17) self-insight and a better self-understanding, and might a ﬀect (5.18) changes in
self-identity (e.g., becoming a ‘new ’, healthy person).
Many behaviour-change groups involve participants (5.11) setting goals , (5.12) reviewing goals or
progress , (5.14) identifying individual barriers and solutions to them , and (5.16) feedback on individual
performance. These techniques, intra-personal in nature, can be facilitated in groups collaboratively
by engaging group participants, discussing their goals, progress or barriers, and thus facilitating
inter-personal change processes, such as sharing experiences, social learning, or accountability.Groups can also provide a context for (5.13) developing and practising new skills and behaviours
that can prompt modelling. They can be good platforms for discussing and sharing ideas for (5.15)self-monitoring , and may provide opportunities for (5.20) learning through association (e.g., using
rewards or incentives) and encouraging (5.19) using self-talk ,
 (5.21) changing or forming habits and238 A. J. BOREK ET AL.
(5.22) stress and emotional management . This is not an exhaustive list; many more intra-personal pro-
cesses involved in behaviour change have been identi ﬁed in other studies. Here we have highlighted
intra-personal change processes commonly targeted in GB-BCIs and especially those that may be par-
ticularly sensitive to group delivery (i.e., those that may be enhanced or impeded by group dynamics,
inter-personal change processes and facilitation techniques).
Facilitator and participant characteristics, and other contextual in ﬂuences
These are factors external to the group that may inﬂ uence, and be in ﬂuenced by, what happens in the
groups (i.e., by group dynamics and inter- and intra-personal change processes). The identi ﬁed (6.1)
facilitator characteristics, that may in ﬂuence the group and participants, include facilitators ’personal-
ity and inter-personal skills (e.g., warmth, relatedness), cognitive and emotional factors in ﬂuencing
their role (e.g., knowledge, experiences, passion), professional skills and experience (e.g., in presen-tation, group management), or demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, relatedhealth conditions). Similarly, we identi ﬁed (6.2) participant characteristics including, for example,
their personality, cognitive and emotional factors, physical or mental health issues, values andbeliefs, initial motivation, personal agenda or reasons to attend, readiness to change, type of locusof control, level of knowledge, or previous experiences. These facilitator and participant character-
istics are ‘brought ’to the group, may in ﬂuence group interaction and relationships (e.g., rapport
with others in the group), and may change over time as a result of participating in, or facilitating,
the groups (e.g., increased assertiveness, con ﬁdence, skills). Some of these characteristics may be
controlled at the GB-BCI design stage by a selection of facilitators or members. Others might bemore di ﬃcult or impractical to control but, to some extent, may be managed in the group
through facilitation techniques. (6.3) Other contextual in ﬂuences may also a ﬀect the group and indi-
vidual change, including, for example, available support networks and social connectedness, positiveor negative in ﬂuences of other people, social situations (e.g., celebrations, eating out) or wider social
norms. All of these factors may be present and a ﬀect participants outside the group but may be also
brought into, and discussed in, the group, thus providing opportunities for inter-personal changeprocesses (e.g., sharing experiences, group problem solving).
Outcomes and wider inﬂ uencing factors
Outcomes of GB-BCIs include a range of intended and unintended outcomes, such as changes in
psychological processes underpinning individual behaviour change, physical health outcomes tar-geted in interventions (e.g., weight loss), and changes in psychological wellbeing (e.g., self-esteem,
self-eﬃcacy, social connectedness, mental health), all of which may improve overall health-related
quality of life. They may also include social change (e.g., in norms or practices) across groups of indi-
viduals. Outcomes may be a ﬀected, directly or indirectly, by inter- and intra-personal change pro-
cesses and the underlying group dynamics. Feedback on outcomes, or perception of progresstowards them (or its lack), can a ﬀect all other elements of GB-BCIs, i.e., group dynamics, change pro-
cesses, facilitation techniques used by the facilitators, and individual characteristics and contextual
factors (as represented in Figure 1 by the black arrows going from Outcomes ). As outcomes are
speciﬁc to each intervention, they are not discussed further here.
Finally, wider in ﬂuencing factors , such as socio-cultural, economic, environmental, community and
organisational factors ,m a yi n ﬂuence all aspects of GB-BCIs, including their design, implementation,
processes, facilitators and participants, and outcomes. For example, economic factors may a ﬀect par-
ticipants ’behaviours (e.g., cost of healthy food) or intervention design and implementation (e.g., pre-
speciﬁed requirements, available resources). We acknowledge the importance of these wider deter-
minants of health, and recognise their impact on group functioning, but these are beyond the focus
of this study.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 239
Discussion
This research identi ﬁed a range of concepts related to group design, delivery, context and change
processes that together explain mechanisms of action capable of generating behaviour change in
group-based behaviour-change interventions (GB-BCIs). These were integrated into a framework,comprising six overarching categories and 62 more speci ﬁc sub-categories, derived from Borek
and Abraham ( 2018 ), reviews of relevant literatures, qualitative coding and expert consultations.
By highlighting how GB-BCIs may inﬂ uence individual psychological and behaviour change, the fra-
mework can be used to guide design, delivery and evaluation of GB-BCIs, and can also inform training
for group facilitators.
Many of the change processes identi ﬁed in the framework likely co-occur and interact dynami-
cally. For example, the process of sharing experiences may prompt social learning and social vali-dation. Inter-personal change processes can occur between individuals (e.g., group members
engage in group problem solving) as well as within individuals (e.g., group members identify sol-
utions to personal barriers in response to group interaction). To optimise eﬀ ectiveness, these may
need to be planned in advance and facilitated in situ during GB-BCIs. Intra-personal change processes
also occur within, and are a ﬀected by, the inter-personal, group context. For example, goal setting
might be speci ﬁed and re ﬁned by sharing and discussing one ’s goals with the group, or impeded
by not having the time or opportunity to su ﬃciently focus and re ﬂect on individual needs. Moreover,
for any behaviour change to occur, inter-personal change processes will need to prompt intra -per-
sonal change, and intra -personal change processes may need to extend outside or beyond the dur-
ation of the group to lead to sustained individual behaviour change. Importantly, some of these
processes may also negatively a ﬀect psychological or behaviour change; for example, identifying
with stigmatised social groups (e.g., Crabtree, Haslam, Postmes, & Haslam, 2010 ) or making social
comparisons with those performing much better than oneself may decrease the motivation, self-eﬃcacy and self-esteem (Abraham & Gardner, 2009 ). Our framework provides a menu from which
to select targeted processes that then need to be carefully designed-into GB-BCIs, actively facilitated,
and checked for feasibility, acceptability and their correct functioning.
GB-BCIs vary greatly in their design, implementation, targeted change mechanisms and outcomes.
The framework o ﬀers a set of categories all of which are more or less important in di ﬀerent GB-BCIs.
Practical limitations can make it di ﬃcult to control all of these processes in intervention design and
implementation. This may, in turn, curtail investigations of change processes during subsequent
process evaluations. Nonetheless, the extent of speci ﬁcity is likely to enhance GB-BCI design, delivery
and evaluation. Striving for design precision is crucial to enable robust evaluation and to optimiseintervention e ﬀectiveness. The MAGI framework provides a categorical system to facilitate design
precision and speci ﬁcation of change processes in logic models. Not all concepts, processes and tech-
niques included in the MAGI framework will be relevant to all interventions. Designers and evaluatorsof GB-BCIs will need to select those categories from the MAGI framework most pertinent to theirintervention depending on the intended change processes, outcomes and delivery context. Use of
the framework in this way would provide a structured basis for further research to empirically estab-
lish the relevance and importance of the speci ﬁc concepts, processes and techniques across di ﬀerent
interventions.
Implications
Implications for GB-BCI design: The framework highlights elements that should be considered when
designing GB-BCIs. Social interaction in GB-BCIs should not be considered as a default and potentially
time-saving ‘delivery method ’but a critical ‘active ingredient ’of behaviour-change interventions.
Therefore, intervention designers need to consider how group dynamics and inter-personalchange processes can generate change and be designed-into, and facilitated during GB-BCIs. Forexample, an intervention might target social identi ﬁcation processes by facilitating the emergence240 A. J. BOREK ET AL.
of a shared social identity in the group (e.g., by ensuring homogeneous group composition and
small group size) and facilitation methods (e.g., by encouraging member interactions, di ﬀerent
types of participation and allowing breaks) (Tarrant et al., 2016 ). Alternatively, the design may
specify changing health-related normative beliefs through changing group norms, facilitated byspeciﬁc group activities, such as group discussions about relevant social norms and normative
beliefs and role plays in which participants critique norms and beliefs that may lead to unhealthy
behaviours or thought patterns (e.g., Cruwys, Haslam, Fox, & McMahon, 2015 )–or both social identi ﬁ-
cation and normative belief changes may be targeted. Moreover, it is important to design and adapt
GB-BCIs to take account of the speci ﬁc characteristics and needs of targeted participants and wider
contextual in ﬂuences. This may include making relevant (e.g., cultural) adaptations, or ensuring that
the selection of participants provides a degree of homogeneity in relation to health needs, socio-economic challenges and cultural commonalities. This can render group activities more relevant to
participants, facilitate better group identi ﬁcation and cohesion, facilitate social validation between
members and minimise the risk of widening health inequalities. The (highly eﬀ ective) Football
Fans in Training intervention is a good example of selecting participants with things in common(being male, overweight football fans) to enhance intra-group cohesion (Gray et al., 2013 ; Hunt
et al., 2014 ). By providing an overview of key change processes operating in groups, the MAGI
framework extends existing guidance on designing health behaviour-change interventions and weenvisage that it will be used in conjunction with such guidance (e.g., Bartholomew, Parcel, Kok,
Gottlieb, & Fernandez, 2016 ; Craig et al., 2008 ; Hoddinott et al., 2010 ; Wight, Wimbush, Jepson, &
Doi, 2016 ).
Implications for GB-BCI delivery: The framework highlights the role of facilitators, their character-
istics and skills in using facilitation techniques, and how these might a ﬀect the operation and main-
tenance of change processes critical to intervention outcomes. Consequently, facilitator training and
competencies are critical to optimising GB-BCI eﬀ ectiveness (e.g., Avery, Whitehead, & Halliday, 2016 ;
Dixon & Johnston, 2010 ; Michie et al., 2011 ; Reddy, Vaughan, & Dunbar, 2010 ). This can be informed
by examination of facilitators ’experiences of delivering GB-BCIs (e.g., Barlow, 2005 ; Catalano, Kendall,
Vandenberg, & Hunter, 2009 ; Hipwell, Turner, & Barlow, 2008 ). Facilitators of GB-BCIs have three main
tasks: to facilitate group dynamics, to ensure delivery of intervention content, and to promote tar-
geted change processes. Identifying and using eﬀ ective techniques to facilitate group dynamics,
including managing counter-productive interaction, is critical, as is expertise in the targeted beha-viours and selected change techniques. The MAGI framework can be used as a resource for groupfacilitators, improving their understanding of the group processes that are sensitive or unique to
group delivery and in designing facilitator training. It is also relevant, for example, to shared consul-
tation groups in general practice for patients with long-term illnesses (Egger, Stevens, Ganora, &Morgan, 2018 ).
Implications for GB-BCI evaluation: The framework can also be a guide to process evaluations of GB-
BCIs. It could help structure group session observations, analyses of session recordings, guide partici-pant and facilitator interviews or design of questionnaires evaluating participant and/or facilitator
perceptions and experiences of GB-BCIs. Investigating the role and impact of speci ﬁc design
elements and group processes, either pre-designed or unintended, can explain how outcomes
were a ﬀected. For example, investigating characteristics of the venue and setting (e.g., organisational
culture and its impact on facilitators and participants) (e.g., Hoddinott, Britten, & Pill, 2010 ), group
dynamics (e.g., group con ﬂicts)
(e.g., Nackers et al., 2015 ) or communication patterns (e.g., facilita-
tor–participant talk ratios) (e.g., Stenov, Henriksen, Folker, Skinner, & Willaing, 2016 ) can explain vari-
ations in intervention outcomes. The MAGI study report (Borek et al., In Press ) provides examples of
how the framework can be used to identify facilitation techniques and change processes from tran-scripts of group sessions, and suggestions for mixed-methods approaches to exploring links between
group processes and outcomes.
Implications for research: Our study suggests also numerous directions for future research on GB-
BCIs. Firstly, the framework could improve speciﬁcation of the GB-BCI content and intended changeHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 241
processes, both in design and reporting. This could facilitate further research and development of
evidence on which of the GB-BCI design features and change processes included in the framework
may improve intervention outcomes. Secondly, systematic reviews that (1) appraise evidence
underpinning each framework concept to justify its inclusion in our framework or estimate its impor-
tance, and (2) that synthesise qualitative studies on people ’s experiences of other types of groups,
could usefully extend and re ﬁne our framework. Further research needs to verify generalisability of
the framework, and re ﬁne it to be applicable, to other types of groups, contexts and populations
(e.g., groups for addictions, management of chronic illness, in education settings, involving partici-pants in di ﬀerent cultural/ethnic backgrounds, children, and delivered one-to-one or virtually/
online). Thirdly, it would be useful to formally map available quantitative measures of group dynamics
and processes to framework concepts to aid selection for use in future research and identify areas for
further development. Our qualitative methods for coding and analysing group sessions , more sophisti-
cated quantitative group-level analyses and further mixed-methods and other approaches (e.g.,
systems-based, realist) could then be developed and applied to facilitate more detailed examinationof mechanisms in GB-BCIs. Linking ﬁndings on mechanisms to data on engagement and outcomes in
particular would help build an evidence base on what group features, facilitation techniques andgroup processes are important, when and for whom in GB-BCIs, and how group dynamics andprocesses are in ﬂuenced by the participant and wider contextual characteristics. Such evidence
would help validate, refute or extend aspects of our framework and be used to improve deliveryor inform design. Finally, developing and evaluating facilitator training toolkits to help facilitators
competently employ speci ﬁc techniques for participant engagement, group dynamics and change
processes, and identifying new facilitation and change techniques would further help to optimise
the delivery of GB-BCIs.
Strengths and limitations
The MAGI framework is, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive theoretical synthesis of change
processes operating in GB-BCIs. It bridges a gap between the extensive literature on group dynamics
in social psychology and the growing literature on individual change processes and techniques inhealth psychology. We drew upon multiple di ﬀerent methods and sources to identify relevant con-
cepts and processes, including literature, qualitative data, and consultations with group participants,facilitators, researchers and practitioners. By combining and triangulating results from the di ﬀerent
steps of the study, we have created a more comprehensive and integrated review than previous
studies (e.g., Davis et al., 2015 ; Grant, Treweek, Dreischulte, Foy, & Guthrie, 2013 ; Pound & Campbell,
2015 ). We kept records of decisions involved in the framework development and its reﬁ nements and
where the included concepts and processes were identi ﬁed, ensuring that the framework develop-
ment process was as transparent as possible (see Borek et al., In Press ).
Due to the extensiveness of the relevant research literature published over decades and across
disciplines, it was not feasible to systematically search and review allpotentially relevant literature
on each of the change processes and concepts included in the framework. We focused primarily
on weight-loss interventions, and on face-to-face groups for adults. Consequently, we might havemissed some characteristics, processes and techniques relevant to GB-BCIs, and generalisability of
the framework to other types of GB-BCIs is yet unclear, especially in groups targeting di ﬀerent beha-
viours, in other types of groups (e.g., online) or in other populations (e.g., children or families).
Our secondary qualitative analyses included data from three interventions that some co-authors
(but not the primary researcher conducting the qualitative analyses) were involved in designing and/
or evaluating. This may have increased familiarity with the data and created expectations regardingtargeted change processes and techniques. We also consulted with 35 experts outside the project
team, including 27 researchers and practitioners, four group facilitators and four group participants,
and incorporated their diverse range of suggestions and advice into the ﬁnal iterations of the frame-
work. Of course, the framework is not an exhaustive list of all processes and techniques. Instead, it242 A. J. BOREK ET AL.
provides the most up-to-date and comprehensive synthesis available that can be further developed,
revised and validated by other researchers.
We also note the limitations inherent in mapping the framework categories to the steps in which
they were identi ﬁed (as reported in the Supplementary Material 1). Di ﬀerent studies might deﬁ ne and
operationalise concepts or processes di ﬀerently, despite using similar terminology. There is also a
variable quantity and quality of evidence supporting the processes and hypotheses included in
our framework, some of which still need to be empirically tested. The categories included in the fra-
mework are, therefore, speci ﬁed and operationalised to di ﬀering extents and there is variation in the
theoretical detail and empirical evidence underpinning them, which should be taken into account
when using the framework to design GB-BCIs. While the framework aims to provide a ‘menu ’of
options, it does not provide recommendations on which change processes should be targeted or
which facilitation techniques should be used and how they should be delivered in practice. All
such categorisation systems evolve as empirical evidence accumulates, and the MAGI framework
is likely to evolve as further research is conducted and evidence accumulates on change processesin a wider range of group interventions.
Conclusion
The mechanisms of action in group-based interventions (MAGI) framework is a synthesis of group
characteristics, change processes and categories of change techniques that can explain individual
behaviour change arising from group-based interventions. The framework summarises groupdesign features, dynamics, development processes, inter- and intra-personal change processes in
groups, and how they interact with each other. It identi ﬁes facilitation techniques used to instigate
and facilitate behaviour change in groups, and acknowledges facilitator and participant character-
istics as well as contextual inﬂ uences that a ﬀect the processes and outcomes in group-based inter-
ventions. It is a comprehensive resource for designers, facilitators and evaluators of GB-BCIs. It can beused to select characteristics and processes important to a particular intervention and so guide inter-vention design and facilitator selection and training.
