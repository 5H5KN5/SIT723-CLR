Abstract 
Background Mental illnesses comprise the single largest source of health‑related economic burden globally, and 
low‑ and middle ‑income countries are disproportionately affected. The majority of people with schizophrenia who 
need treatment do not receive it and are often wholly reliant on family caregivers for daily care and support. Fam‑
ily interventions have an exceptionally robust evidence base for their efficacy in high‑resource settings, but it is 
unknown whether they can produce equivalent effects in some low‑resource settings where cultural beliefs, explana‑
tory models of illness and contextual socio ‑economic issues differ.
Methods This protocol describes the methods for a randomised controlled trial to determine the feasibility of testing 
culturally adapt and refine an evidence ‑based, family intervention for relatives and caregivers of people with schizo ‑
phrenia in Indonesia. The feasibility and acceptability of implementing our adapted, co ‑produced intervention via task 
shifting in primary care settings will be evaluated using the Medical Research Council framework for complex inter ‑
ventions. We will recruit 60 carer ‑service ‑user dyads and randomise them in a 1:1 ratio either to receive our manual‑
ised intervention or continue to receive treatment as usual. Healthcare workers in primary care settings will be trained 
to deliver family interventions using our manualised intervention by a family intervention specialist. Participants will 
complete the ECI, IEQ, KAST and GHQ. Service ‑user symptom level and relapse status will be measured using the 
PANSS at baseline, post ‑intervention and 3 months later by trained researchers. Fidelity to the intervention model will 
be measured using the FIPAS. Qualitative evaluation will further assist with refining the intervention, evaluating trial 
processes and evaluating acceptability.
Discussion National healthcare policy in Indonesia supports the delivery of mental health services in a complex 
network of primary care centres. This study will provide important information on the feasibility of delivering family 
interventions for people with schizophrenia via task shifting in primary care settings in Indonesia and allow further 
refinement of the intervention and trial processes.

Background
Mental illnesses comprise the single largest source of 
health-related economic burden globally [1 ], and low- 
and middle-income countries are disproportionately 
affected. Schizophrenia, the most common psychotic 
illness, is among the ten most disabling conditions 
worldwide, and global burden is projected to rise [2 ]. 
High treatment gaps contribute significantly to illness 
burden; less than a third of those who develop schizo -
phrenia access treatment in lower resource settings [3 ]. 
In Indonesia, as in other lower resource settings, peo -
ple with schizophrenia are often wholly reliant on fam -
ily caregivers for daily care and support [4 , 5]. Fewer 
resources, poor infrastructure and a lack of trained pro -
fessionals to deliver evidence-based care are prominent 
external factors that lead to increased caregiver burden 
[6]. Caregivers often attribute supernatural causes to 
mental illnesses in Indonesia and seek care from tradi -
tional healers or shamans [4 ].
Effective packages of care for schizophrenia comprise 
both pharmacological and psychosocial interventions 
[7]. It is broadly considered that, in low- and middle-
income countries, a narrower group of interventions 
will be feasible due to lack of finance and infrastructure, 
population density and underdeveloped social welfare 
systems [8 ]. The World Bank’s recently published third 
edition of global disease priorities (DCP3) includes 
family interventions for psychosis as one of only three 
potentially cost-effective interventions for people with 
schizophrenia and recommend these interventions 
should be prioritised in low- and middle-income coun -
tries [9 ]. Family interventions have an exceptionally 
robust evidence base for their efficacy in high-resource 
settings [10, 11] and have an emerging evidence base 
in low- and middle-income countries [12]. Providing 
these interventions can reduce relapse and improve 
the family environment and therapeutic alliances with 
healthcare workers [13].
Family members and caregivers of patients with severe 
mental illness experience considerable burden [14], 
exceeding the burden experienced by family members 
caring for those with comparable long-term physical ill -
nesses such as cancer. Families report significant psy -
chological distress, lower quality of life and increased 
anxiety and depression [15]. Meta-analytic studies show 
that interventions comprising both psychoeducation 
and psychotherapeutic elements can reduce the risk of 
relapse and rehospitalisation [10, 16], increase adherence 
to medication regimes [10, 16], enhance functioning [17] 
and improve family environment [10, 18]. Psychoeduca -
tional interventions minimise perceived burden and neg -
ative caregiving experiences [11]. There is also evidence 
that families contribute positively to the wellbeing of people with psychosis, particularly if they themselves are 
supported by family interventions [16].
However, family interventions designed and tested 
for delivery in high-income countries may not produce 
equivalent effects in low- and middle-income countries 
as they do not allow for cultural beliefs, explanatory 
models of illness and contextual socio-economic issues 
to be incorporated into intervention content and delivery 
[19]. Indeed, when effective interventions are successfully 
adapted, the acceptability of interventions increases, and 
people are more likely to engage with help that is offered. 
Interventions within specific cultural groups delivered 
in their native language are twice as efficacious as those 
delivered without adaptation, and cultural adaptation 
enhances intervention efficacy for treating schizophre -
nia; the degree of adaptation closely correlated with the 
degree of efficacy [19].
This study describes a protocol for a mixed-methods 
inquiry guided by an accepted framework for develop -
ing complex interventions to adapt an existing evidence-
based intervention. Subsequently, we aim to determine 
whether it would be feasible to test the effectiveness 
of this intervention in a randomised trial evaluating 
recruitment, retention and participant engagement with 
the intervention. Coinciding with this, we will assess 
healthcare workers acceptance of the intervention 
model and optimise sustainability by evaluating barri -
ers and enablers from the perspectives of stakeholders 
and key informants in positions of potential influence to 
the delivery of mental healthcare locally and regionally. 
A third and equal priority aim is to determine whether 
the intervention can be delivered via shifting this task to 
non-specialist healthcare workers. Task-shifted interven -
tions for noncommunicable diseases can provide cost 
savings without compromising on quality [20] and should 
be explored as an option for lower resource settings to 
deliver evidence-based treatments and alleviate health 
system inefficiencies [21].
Methods
Aims and objectives
This study details the methods to be used to culturally 
adapt and refine an evidence-based, family intervention 
for relatives and caregivers of people with schizophrenia 
in Indonesia and to evaluate the feasibility and acceptabil -
ity of implementing these interventions in primary care 
settings. Using the Medical Research Council framework 
for complex interventions, we will conduct a three-phase 
study focusing on earlier phases of development and fea -
sibility testing [22]. We will combine stakeholder consul -
tation, synthesis and consensus workshops using service 
users, carers and healthcare professional’s perspectives to 
develop a manual to guide intervention development. We 
Page 3 of 11
 Renwick et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:53 
 
will train healthcare workers to deliver the intervention 
and assess the feasibility and acceptability of conducting 
a randomised, single-blind trial of our co-produced, cul -
turally relevant, evidence-based intervention to reduce 
relapse when compared with standard care.
The study objectives are as follows:
1. Explore preferences and priorities for delivering fam -
ily interventions for relatives and carers of people 
with schizophrenia in Java, Indonesia.
2. Synthesise findings from stakeholder interviews with 
an existing evidence-based intervention using a heu -
ristic model for adaptation.
3. Gain consensus on the components, format and 
delivery of the intervention.
4. Produce a manual to support the delivery of the cul -
turally adapted intervention.
5. Explore wider factors that may hinder or facilitate the 
adoption, reach and effectiveness of the intervention 
delivery and implementation.
6. Train healthcare professionals to deliver the inter -
vention in primary care settings.
7. Assess the feasibility of testing the intervention in a 
full trial and explore the acceptability of the interven -
tion to a wide group of stakeholders.
The aims of the feasibility trial are to evaluate the 
following:
1. Acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention
2. Recruitment, attendance and retention in the 
intervention
3. Completion of outcome measures pre- and post-
intervention
4. Recruitment of healthcare workers as therapists
5. Fidelity to the intervention and experience of deliver -
ing the intervention
The feasibility aims will be used to inform intervention 
refinement and development of main trial procedures 
with respect to intervention acceptability, fidelity and 
retention in the intervention. Success criteria for pro -
gression to a main trial include the following:
1. Recruitment of two dyads/families per centre (three 
in total) per month
2. Recruitment of a minimum of one healthcare worker 
per site to deliver the family intervention
3. Completion of 80% of outcome measures at baseline, 
post-intervention and 3 months later
Success criteria have been reviewed and approved by 
the Trial Steering Committee.Design
Our culturally adapted, co-refined intervention will 
be tested in a single-blind, randomised trial to deter -
mine the feasibility of testing this intervention in a 
full-scale trial. Carers will be assessed on their level of 
knowledge, attitudes, burden and general well-being at 
three time points: pre-intervention, post-intervention 
and 3 months following intervention completion. Par -
ticipant dyads in the control group will continue to 
receive treatment as they usually would; there will be 
no attempt to withhold any treatment. Additionally, 
we will conduct individual interviews to obtain quali -
tative data regarding satisfaction with the intervention 
and acceptability for delivering the intervention com -
ponents. This information will be integrated with data 
from key informant interviews using an implementation 
framework to develop knowledge about the key facets 
of intervention delivery by task shifting in primary care 
settings. Patients and carers were closely involved in 
the conceptualisation, development and design of this 
study, and the initial research question was inspired by 
reports from carer groups of the lack of evidence-based 
interventions for families of people with schizophrenia 
in Indonesia. The feasibility trial has been registered 
(ISRCTN49498363).
Setting and context
Indonesia is a large archipelago comprising approxi -
mately 17,000 islands and roughly 300 different tribes. 
The prevalence of psychotic illness is 1.8 per 1000, 
and there is an estimated 2.6 million people with 
schizophrenia [23]. Mental healthcare is largely pro -
vided in one of Indonesia’s large regional public hos -
pitals. Community mental health provision is limited; 
carers and families receive limited formal support by 
trained and experienced clinicians, although there is 
emerging specialist mental healthcare provided within 
a more advanced network of primary care clinics: 
puskesmas and posyandu (primary care clinics at dis -
trict and sub-district level) providing comprehensive 
healthcare for all healthcare needs at district and sub-
district level. Prevailing explanatory models of mental 
illness favour supernatural theories over biomedical 
explanations, but often families lack knowledge of 
treatment availability and approaches to recovery to 
manage crises and support social functioning. The 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals have 
for the first time focused on reducing the burden of 
mental illness scaling up prevention and treatment 
strategies. Coupled with the World Health Organi -
zations focus on task shifting to increase capacity 
for intervention delivery and integration between 
Page 4 of 11 Renwick et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:53 
primary and secondary mental health services, there 
is a need to develop family interventions that are evi -
dence-based, can be delivered by non-specialist pro -
fessionals and are scalable. Task shifting describes 
when healthcare tasks are redistributed to enhance 
the performance of health systems. Typically, tasks 
normally provided by a specialist health worker are 
transferred to a healthcare worker with a lower level 
of education and training or a person specifically 
trained to perform a limited task such as peer or lay 
workers. We aim to conduct this trial in primary care 
settings where nonmental health workers are respon -
sible for delivery of mental healthcare due to national 
healthcare policy in Indonesia which supports the 
delivery of mental health services in primary care and 
aims to provide universal healthcare provision for 
those with diagnosed mental health conditions [24]. 
Ethical approval has been granted by the University 
of Manchester Research Ethics Committee for phases 
1 and 2 (2020-8041-13687) and phase 3 (2022-14819-
25424) of the project.
Participants and recruitment
Recruitment in the feasibility trial will commence in 
November 2022. Participants comprising service users, 
carers and relatives and healthcare professionals through 
phase will be primarily recruited from primary health -
care centres in Bogor and Jakarta via information post -
ers placed in strategic locations in participating primary 
care centres. We will also recruit through our NGO part -
ners, Komunitas Peduli Skizofreni Indonesia (KPSI). Our 
social media strategy for recruitment encompasses public mental health education and awareness groups supported 
by our NGO partners using varied social media (Face -
book, Twitter, Instagram). Inclusion and exclusion crite -
ria are detailed in Table 1.
A sample of 60 dyads including an identified primary 
carer will be recruited, and these will be allocated ran -
domly to receive either the experimental intervention 
or treatment as usual aiming for 30 dyads per arm as 
guided by good practice [25]. Patients and family mem -
bers will be recruited together and will be asked to con -
tact the researcher directly and separately to confirm 
participation if they express an interest. Staff in pri -
mary care centres will also be given information about 
the study. Written informed consent will be sought at 
an initial screening and baseline assessment meeting. 
Additionally, we will recruit 12–15 healthcare profes -
sionals to deliver the intervention by advert and using 
information giving sessions at primary care centres. 
Healthcare workers will be included if they have a per -
manent contract in a primary care centre in Jakarta or 
Bogor, have primary responsibility for delivering the 
mental health programme and have delivered family 
interventions to a minimum of one service-user/family 
member dyad.
Intervention development
An existing evidence-based family intervention devel -
oped by Barrowclough and Tarrier [26] was adapted 
using a heuristic framework for culturally adapting psy -
chosocial interventions [19]. We explored stakeholder 
preferences and priorities for delivering family inter -
views in consultation groups purposively sampling from Table 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

service user, carer and healthcare professional groups (6 
groups of 8 participants). We conducted two consulta -
tion groups per stakeholder group in line with evidence 
that high levels of both code and meaning saturation 
can be attained with two focus groups [27]. We explored 
the views of key informants (n  = 10) regarding factors 
affecting implementation of the intervention in pri -
mary care settings in individual qualitative interviews. 
This allowed us to understand the wider implications of 
intervention implementation and evaluate factors affect -
ing reach, adoption and maintenance of interventions 
devolved to non-specialist mental health workers in pri -
mary care settings. Key informants are individuals who 
have in-depth knowledge about the community and the 
target population, community access for healthcare and 
processes involved in the distribution and delivery of 
mental health services, and as such are best positioned 
to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of 
interventions and the successful completion of a feasibil -
ity study and future trial. Data from consultation groups 
and individual interviews were analysed using the 
framework method [28, 29]. Data were analysed by Indo -
nesian researchers, and a sample of scripts (20%) were 
transcribed and translated, and coding frame agreed 
with the wider study team at UI and UoM. We devised 
an evidence matrix combining empirical findings from 
the qualitative phases of the study with empirical find -
ings from existing evidence synthesis of cultural adapta -
tion for psychosocial and mental health interventions. 
Guided by the methodology of Lovell et al. [30], the evi -
dence matrix assisted with understanding the common -
alities and disagreements between stakeholder views 
from different sources of evidence and supports deci -
sion-making regarding possible content, duration and 
delivery of the intervention. Areas of divergence were 
taken forward to a consensus workshop using nominal 
group technique (NGT), to obtain consensus on aspects 
of intervention delivery that were not clearly agreed fol -
lowing analysis at the first stage. Originally developed as 
an organisational planning tool, the NGT has been effec -
tively implemented in mental health research [31, 32] to 
allow divergent ideas to be expressed and collated with 
a view to identifying areas of consensus. Each item was 
presented, and voting conducted in secret, where agree -
ment was not obtained by majority consensus (> 75% 
concordance); researchers facilitated structured discus -
sion until consensus was reached. The panel was iden -
tified and appointed by the RAG, and we determined a 
sample size of 20 was required to ensure adequate repre -
sentation from different stakeholders in a mixed-forum 
event [33].
Our co-produced intervention will be delivered over 10 
sessions to individual families comprising the following components: initial assessment of relative and patient 
needs, education about psychosis, stress management 
and coping resources, problem-solving and communica -
tion therapy and goal setting and relapse prevention. The 
manual was developed by the wider study team defining 
therapeutic aims and describing detailed procedures, 
patient exercises, materials and resources, good practice 
examples, case studies, skills practice sessions for inter -
vention delivery and measures of processes and out -
comes. Consensus was reached regarding the number (up 
to 10) and duration of sessions (approximately 60 min), 
location of sessions (domiciliary visit) and including the 
service user in some elements of the intervention (assess -
ment, giving feedback and education about the illness). 
Study objectives 1–5 were met during the stages of devel -
opment of the intervention, and methods for obtaining 
feasibility objectives (objectives 6 & 7) are described here.
Outcomes and measures
The primary outcome is to determine the feasibility of 
family interventions delivered by non-specialist health -
care workers in primary care settings. Feasibility meas -
ures comprise evaluations of acceptability, recruitment, 
retention and fidelity to intervention components and 
delivery. Secondary outcomes relating to the feasibility of 
obtaining relevant measures for a full-scale trial comprise 
assessments of symptom severity and relapse rates, social 
functioning, family functioning and environment and 
therapeutic engagement. Analysis will comprise obtain -
ing descriptive statistics and aggregating data to opera -
tionalise relapse as an outcome Table 2.
Psychosis symptom severity and relapse
Clinical symptoms will be evaluated using the PANSS 
[34] which is a valid scale and has been used in many 
non-English-speaking countries [35–37]. The validity 
and reliability of the Indonesian version have also been 
established [38]. Relapse is operationalised as an increase 
from mild or below to severe or very severe on one of 
the following symptoms rated using the PANSS: unusual 
thought content, hallucinations and conceptual disorgan -
isation for a minimum duration of 1 week [39, 40]. The 
PANSS will be administered by specially trained research 
assistants at baseline, immediately after the interven -
tion and 3 months after the intervention. Diagnosis and 
previous hospital episodes will be obtained from clini -
cal notes, although hospitalisation may be a less relevant 
proxy measure of relapse in LMIC settings [40].
Social functioning
Service-user social functioning will be measured using 
the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP). This is 
a 100-point, observer-rated, single-item scale comprising 
Page 6 of 11 Renwick et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:53 
occupational activities, relationships, self-care and 
socially unacceptable behaviours. It is a reliable, accept -
able and valid measure of social functioning in people 
with schizophrenia [41, 42] and sensitive to change in 
PANSS scores [42] and has been utilised in Indonesian 
populations previously [43].
Caregiver psychological wellbeing
The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12; 
[44]) was developed to screen for non-specific psychiat -
ric morbidity and has been widely validated and found 
to be reliable. It is commonly used as a screening tool to 
determine whether an individual is at risk of developing a 
psychiatric disorder. It comprises 12 Likert-type question 
items that measure a single dimension of psychological 
health. The Indonesian‐language version of the GHQ‐12 
has been tested for reliability and validity, demonstrat -
ing good consistency and sensitivity (Idaiani & Suhardi, 
2006).Caregiver burden
The Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire (IEQ; [45] is 
a 31-item questionnaire comprising items relating to ten -
sion, supervision, worrying and urging and the degree 
to which the caregiver has experienced any of these. The 
scale has been developed for European settings, though 
it has been translated and validated in several European 
countries and in LMIC settings [46].
Carer burden will also be measured using the Experi -
ence of Caregiving Inventory which captures a wider set 
of negative subscales comprising difficult behaviours, 
negative symptoms, stigma, problems with services, 
effects on the family, loss and need for backup. There 
are two positive subscales consisting of positive personal 
outcomes and good aspects of the relationship with the 
patient about the carer’s experiences. This measure has 
been used with a variety of carers of mental health condi -
tions, and each subscale has been reported to have satis -
factory reliability [47].Table 2 Variables, measures and assessment points

Family functioning and environment
Expressed emotion (EE) will be measured using the Fam -
ily Questionnaire (FQ; [48]). The questionnaire comprises 
20 items each measured on a 4-point scale and consists of 
two subscales assessing both emotional over-involvement 
and critical comments. The FQ has excellent psychomet -
ric properties including a clear factor structure, good 
internal consistency of subscales and good inter-rater 
reliability in relation to the Camberwell Family Interview 
(CFI; [49]) which is the gold standard measure of EE and 
is sensitive to predicting components of EE.
Knowledge
Knowledge about schizophrenia and psychosis will be 
measured among participants using the Knowledge About 
Schizophrenia Test (KAST) [50] which was developed for 
caregivers of people admitted to hospital for treatment of 
psychosis. The test comprises 21 items regarding the aeti -
ology, onset, symptomatology, outcome and treatment 
options. The measure shows excellent content validity and 
good criterion validity. This scale, the FQ, ECI and IEQ, 
will be cross-culturally adapted following similar proce -
dures outlined by Knudsen et  al. [51], comprising series 
of translations, back-translations and checking through 
qualitative inquiry with research assistants and partici -
pants in the feasibility study about item validity. Transla -
tion will be conducted by researchers independent of the 
study team, and back-translation will be conducted by the 
Indonesian researchers in the study team.
Fidelity to the intervention model
Fidelity to the intervention will be measured using 
the Family Intervention in Psychosis Adherence Scale (FIPAS) [52]. The scale authors have demonstrated that 
the majority of items of the FIPAS have acceptable levels 
of inter-rater reliability. Healthcare workers delivering 
the intervention will keep a diary following each session 
to evaluate their opinions of fidelity, factors that they 
felt may have influenced their fidelity and their views 
regarding elements that were useful and those that were 
less useful. Treatment fidelity will also be monitored 
during qualitative inquiry with healthcare workers who 
have delivered the intervention. Pre-specified criterion 
for fidelity will be used interpreting 80–100% adherence 
as ‘high’ fidelity, 51–79% as ‘moderate’ and 0–50% as 
‘low’ fidelity [53].
Qualitative process evaluation
Qualitative interview data on participants’ views of the 
intervention will be obtained in individual, semi-struc -
tured interviews at intervention completion. These inter -
views will be digitally recorded, transcribed, checked for 
accuracy and analysed using framework analysis [54]. 
Again, data will be analysed by Indonesian researchers, 
and a sample of scripts (20%) were transcribed, translated 
and coding frame agreed with the wider study team at 
UI and UoM. Process evaluation will be informed by the 
Medical Research Council guidance on process evalua -
tion in designing and testing interventions [55]. We will 
use a version of the Consolidated Framework for Imple -
mentation Research optimised for use in low- and mid -
dle-income countries [56] to conduct an implementation 
analysis that will also inform the feasibility trial which 
will be finalised prior to a definitive trial utilising qualita -
tive data regarding trial processes integrated with qualita -
tive data collected during the intervention development.

Procedures
Data will be collected from participants in intervention 
and control groups at three time points: pre-interven -
tion, post-intervention and 3 months later. Participants 
within the control group will receive treatment as 
usual. Standard care comprises limited community ser -
vices in primary care settings providing public educa -
tion, counselling, basic psychiatric services [57] and the 
provision of pharmacological treatment and monitor -
ing at out-patient facilities at regional mental health 
hospitals. As an active comparator and to evaluate 
the amount of treatment received by both arms of the 
trial, all participants will be asked about the extent of 
treatment and intervention received at regional hospi -
tals and local primary care centres. Demographic data 
collected include age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, 
education, and employment will also be collated. As 
appropriate, we will gather information about the liv -
ing arrangements, primary diagnosis of service user, 
duration of the caring role, number of people cared for, 
relationship to the person with schizophrenia, whether 
they live with the person, level and type of contact and 
whether they are receiving support from mental health 
services. Healthcare professionals will provide informa -
tion about the nature of their work and whether they 
have received specific mental health training, contact 
with people with mental health problems and duration 
of service Table 3 .
Procedure for randomisation and blinding
Online randomisation services will be provided by a tele -
phone randomisation service (www. seale  denve  lope. com), 
and participants will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio. Randomi -
sation will be conducted according to the International 
Conference on Harmonization E9 Statistical Principles 
Guidelines and will be implemented by the trial man -
ager. Upon confirmation of eligibility by the principal 
investigator in Indonesia (HS), the participant will be 
randomised to one of the treatment arms. Allocation 
sequence will be kept from the study researchers respon -
sible for obtaining baseline, and outcome measures and 
trial management personnel responsible for allocation 
will work in separate locations. Participants will be asked 
not to reveal their allocation to the study researchers/
study evaluators.
Training and supervision
Healthcare workers will be trained in the intervention 
by an experienced, family intervention specialist, and we 
will train additional academic colleagues who will pro -
vide clinical supervision to healthcare workers in prac -
tice. The training will be delivered intensively over 1 week 
comprising 9 workshop sessions with skills practice and an additional session to establish a supervision frame -
work and evaluate the delivery of training. Symptom 
evaluators will be trained to implement the interview 
schedule and assess symptoms by trained symptom eval -
uators among the study team. Symptom evaluators will 
be blind to treatment allocation, and inter-rater reliabil -
ity will be measured on concordance between raters on 
a minimum of 5 standardised observer-rated symptom 
measures [39, 58]. As above, a supervision framework 
will be developed during training to ensure that health -
care workers in primary care settings have access to regu -
lar supervision with colleagues experienced in mental 
healthcare and education.
Research data management
The project will primarily use the Research Data Ser -
vice at UI to store, manage and curate data. Data will be 
stored using Word and Excel documents and transferred 
to research analysis software when required for analy -
sis and distribution checks. Quality checks will be con -
ducted periodically, and coding will be overseen by the 
study teams at UI and UoM. We will also utilise the UoM 
Research Data Management Service (RDMS) which pro -
vides, managed and secure replicated storage. The RDMS 
allows researchers to securely transfer digital data to 
UoM and can be used to store, manage and curate data 
to preserve this after the lifecycle of the project. Non-dig -
ital data, e.g. consent forms and manuals generated from 
the research programme, will be stored in stand-alone 
locked cabinets held in a secure location in UI. Data will 
be stored in raw, processed, analysed and final dataset 
format to ensure quality and will be transferred between 
host and sponsor university using Dropbox for Business.
Trial oversight
The study is supported by a Research Advisory Group 
(RAG) who are independent of the study team and com -
prises service users, carers and advocates, healthcare 
professionals and primary care workers, academics, 
community leaders and government healthcare officials 
(n = 11). The RAG provide insight and information on 
the needs of the researchers and the research project 
using pre-specified terms of reference. The group has 
provided expertise on research processes and interven -
tion development including comment on analysis of 
qualitative data, comment on the presentation of inter -
vention and training manuals once developed and com -
ment on assessment schedules for the feasibility study. 
Additionally, the RAG will provide oversight to the fea -
sibility trial as a Trial Steering Committee chaired by a 
separate member than oversight of the RAG. The steer -
ing committee will approve the final protocol before the 
feasibility trial commences. The RAG will also take a

lead role in the dissemination phase devising plans for 
investigators and sponsor to communicate trial results 
to participants, healthcare professionals, the public and 
other relevant groups. The group will be chaired by the 
Director of Mental Health and Drug Control, Ministry 
of Health in Indonesia. Additional service-user and carer 
representatives will be recruited at each phase and ser -
vice-user involvement organised by our charity partners 
Komunitas Peduli Skizofrenia Indonesia (KPSI). KPSI is a 
user-led charity which runs peer support groups, educa -
tion and anti-stigma activities in health services and local 
communities.
Discussion
This study will provide important information on the 
feasibility of delivering family interventions for people 
with schizophrenia who reside in circumscribed areas 
of Indonesia. The intervention has a solid evidence base 
for delivery in high-income settings and is a NICE rec -
ommended intervention and the model of choice in NHS 
trusts [26, 59]. Importantly, family interventions have 
been successfully adapted to minority populations in the 
UK [60] and in other low-resource settings [61, 62]. As 
far as we are currently aware, these types of interventions 
have not previously been adapted culturally to Indone -
sian populations and contexts nor have co-production 
methods been utilised in this way to develop an interven -
tion informed by stakeholder perspectives, preferences 
and priorities, and the findings of this trial will provide 
a unique and novel contribution to knowledge of family 
interventions for schizophrenia in this context.
We have focused on implementation within the devel -
opment phase of this research to ensure that family 
interventions can be embedded within existing health -
care delivery settings using the more extensive network 
of primary care services available in Indonesia. Mental 
health treatment is often provided by mental health pro -
fessionals whose names and qualifications are maintained 
in a central government register, and they are licensed 
to practice in specialty settings. These specialist mental 
health providers are not readily available in Indonesia 
due to manpower and resource shortages, fledgling pro -
fessional development, economically challenged popula -
tions and a lack of mental health as a priority in policy 
agendas. As an example, mental health nurses in Indo -
nesia are not regulated by government legislation, and 
degree courses have only been available since 2005 [63], 
and our approach is a unique strength of this study.
Guided by the World Health Organizations promotion 
of task-shifting models, our aim is to increase capacity 
for intervention delivery recognising the need for inte -
gration between primary and secondary mental health 
services and to develop family interventions that can be delivered by non-specialist professionals and are scalable 
[64]. While this is a novel approach in Indonesia, recruit -
ment to our feasibility trial may be challenged by having 
fewer staff resources to deliver family interventions par -
ticularly as we have chosen an individualised intervention. 
Nonetheless, family interventions delivered intensively 
have a strong evidence base [10], and our choice partly 
reflected service-user and carers stated preference for 
personalised, tailored interventions. Utilising patient-
centred approaches and co-design to develop interven -
tion content and processes may also help to overcome 
challenges of recruiting dyads, which has previously been 
problematic in family intervention research and prac -
tice [17, 65]. To date, we have successfully recruited par -
ticipants for the first two phases of the project, collected 
qualitative data and analysed and synthesised findings to 
inform our culturally adapted manual of evidence-based 
family interventions. Our coadapted and refined interven -
tion will be administered in this feasibility trial informed 
by stakeholder preferences and priorities. Our approach 
aims to enhance the acceptability of and satisfaction with 
the intervention through embedding relevant and cultur -
ally sensitive content and processes within the interven -
tion training and delivery.
Conducting a feasibility study presents multiple oppor -
tunities to refine procedures and processes to inform 
conduct of a more definitive trial at a later point. Indeed, 
the aim of this trial is to inform the further development 
of both the intervention and a larger trial with sufficient 
power to determine the cost and clinical effectiveness of 
family interventions. We aim to optimise the interven -
tion and trial processes using the oversight of the Trial 
Steering Committee in determining the feasibility and 
acceptability of the intervention for a future trial. Our 
anticipated findings will be a refined, testable, manual -
ised intervention that aims to reduce relapse for people 
with psychosis and schizophrenia. We will be able to 
determine whether we can feasibly recruit sufficient par -
ticipants to test the effects of the intervention and recruit 
sufficient healthcare workers to determine whether they 
can be adequately trained to provide such an interven -
tion in its intended format.
