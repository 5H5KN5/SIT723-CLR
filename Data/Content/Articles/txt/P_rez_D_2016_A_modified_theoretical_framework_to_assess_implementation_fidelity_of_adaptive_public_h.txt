implementation fidelity of adaptive public
health interventions

Abstract
Background: One of the major debates in implementation research turns around fidelity and adaptation. Fidelity
is the degree to which an intervention is implemented as intended by its developers. It is meant to ensure that the
intervention maintains its intended effects. Adaptation is the process of implementers or users bringing changes
to the original design of an intervention. Depending on the nature of the modifications brought, adaptation could
either be potentially positive or could carry the risk of threatening the theoretical basis of the intervention, resulting
in a negative effect on expected outcomes. Adaptive interventions are those for which adaptation is allowed or
even encouraged. Classical fidelity dimensions and conceptual frameworks do not address the issue of how to
adapt an intervention while still maintaining its effectiveness.
Discussion: We support the idea that fidelity and adaptation c o-exist and that adaptations can impact either
positively or negatively on the intervention ’s effectiveness. For adaptive interventions, research should answer
the question how an adequate fidelity-adaptation bal ance can be reached. One way to address this issue is by
looking systematically at the aspects of an interventio n that are being adapted. We conducted fidelity research
on the implementation of an empowerment strategy fo r dengue prevention in Cuba. In view of the adaptive
nature of the strategy, we anticipated that the classica l fidelity dimensions would be of limited use for assessing
adaptations. The typology we used in the assessment —implemented, not-implemented, modified, or added
components of the strategy —also had limitations. It did not allow us to answer the question which of the
modifications introduced in the strategy contribute d to or distracted from outcomes. We confronted our
empirical research with existing literature on fidelity, and as a result, considered that the framework for
implementation fidelity proposed by Carroll et al. in 2007 could potentially meet our concerns. We propose
modifications to the framework to assess both fidelity and adaptation.
Summary: The modified Carroll et al. ’s framework we propose may permit a comprehensive assessment of the
implementation fidelity-adaptation balance required when implementing adaptive interventions, but more
empirical research is needed to validate it.

Background
Some authors argue that intervention research is a set
of sequential studies (i.e., efficacy, effectiveness, and
dissemination) that provides different kinds of evidence
about an intervention [1, 2]. Rychectnik et al. [3], based
on Nutbean and Bauman [4], formulated how to
proceed while building evidence for innovative inter-
ventions: assessing process and outcome/impact of the
intervention (intervention testing); determining if simi-
lar outcomes can be reprodu ced when the intervention
is adapted to other settings or populations (intervention
replication); and examining real population outcomes
and public health benefits (intervention dissemination).
Replication and dissemination studies are rooted on the
assumption of the potential translation of evidence-
based interventions to new settings and hinge on im-
plementation issues.
Implementation is a specific set of purposeful pro-
cesses and activities designed to put into practice an
intervention or program of known dimensions [5],
which requires to be measured with outcomes that are
conceptually and empirica lly distinct from those to
assess intervention effectiveness [5 –7]. Distinguishing
between “implementation ”and “intervention ”outcomes
is critical. When translation efforts fail, it helps to de-
termine if the failure occurred because the intervention
was ineffective (intervention failure) or whether it was
deployed incorrectly (implementation failure) [7].
Translating evidence-based health interventions has
resulted in one of the major dilemmas in implementa-
tion research: fidelity versus adaptation [8, 9]. Fidelity
or the degree to which an intervention is implemented
as intended by its developers [8 –14] is an implementa-
tion outcome [7] that is particularly meant to ensure that
the intervention maintains its intended effects [8 –14]. On
the opposite, adaptation is the process of bringing changes
to the original design of an intervention by its imple-
menters or users [9, 11, 12]. Fidelity and adaptation are
closely linked but remain two opposed concepts. The
highest the level of the fidelity achieved, the less there
are changes brought to the original design of an inter-
vention. Inversely, the more an intervention is adapted,
the more likely the fidelity can be threatened.
Several studies have demonstrated that the fidelity
with which an intervention i s implemented affects its
effectiveness [8 –15]. Hence, achieving high fidelity has
been the overriding concer n for many researchers who
struggle to move from efficacy studies to real-world im-
plementation, in particular in the field of pharmaco-
logical and psychosocial interventions designed to treat
specific health problems [16 –18]. However, in practice,
the adaptation of interventions has been the rule rather
than the exception [9, 10]. Moreover, some authors
have argued that certain interventions might need to beadapted in the course of its implementation [9, 11, 12].
This is the case of adaptive interventions .W ed e f i n e
these as interventions for which stakeholders are
allowed, or even encouraged, to bring changes to the
original design. This definition includes the type of
adaptive intervention as defined by Collins et al. [19]
and Nahum-Shani et al. [20], where pre-defined
changes are allowed by the intervention developers. For
this type of adaptive interventions, fidelity is important
to ensure that pre-defined adaptations occurred as
intended. However, adaptive interventions also include
not pre-defined changes originating from implemen-
ters. This kind of changes occur more in the context of
complex public health interventions involving different
organizational levels and targeting collective behaviors
than in interventions targeting individuals with differ-
ent needs and where the control of the implementation
process by the intervention developers is not possible
or even desirable.
Examples of such adaptive interventions are empower-
ment strategies for disease prevention and control.
Empowerment is a process through which individuals,
groups, and communities are provided with the capabil-
ities to take power over decisions that affect their lives
[21, 22]. Indeed, promoting participation in decision-
making implies a high degree of uncertainty as to what
will be planed and/or achieved. In all cases, depending
on the nature of the modifications brought to the original
design of an intervention, adaptation could either be
potentially positive or could carry the risk of threatening
the theoretical basis of the intervention, resulting in a
negative effect on expected outcomes [8, 12].
While five dimensions [adherence, dose, quality of
delivery, participant responsiveness, and program dif-
ferentiation] have been put forward and are commonly
used for measuring fidelity [8 –15], there has been little
research or practical advice on how to adapt an inter-
vention to maintain its effective ingredients and mecha-
nisms [12]. On the basis of a critical systematic review
of existing conceptualizations of implementation fidel-
ity, Carroll et al. [15] proposed a conceptual framework
for understanding and measuring this concept. They
acknowledged that adaptations are likely to occur in
real-world implementation, but the question on how to
address this issue while measuring fidelity remained
unanswered.
In this debate paper, we argue that for adaptive
interventions, the issue of fidelity cannot be apprehended
independently from the issue of adaptation and that both
concepts are intrinsically linked. We then propose a modi-
fied Carroll et al. ’s framework for implementation fidelity
bringing together literature on fidelity and results from
our empirical research in this field in order to provide a
better fit for adaptive interventions.Pérez et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:91 Page 2 of 11
Carroll et al. ’s conceptual framework for implementation
fidelity
As previously stated, in the last decade-and-a-half, the
concept of implementation fidelity has been described
and defined in terms of five dimensions that need to be
measured: adherence —program implementation as de-
scribed; dose —frequency and duration of the exposure
to the program; quality of delivery —manner in which
the program is delivered; participant responsive-
ness—the degree to which participants are engaged;
and program differentiation —critical features that dis-
tinguishes the program [8 –14]. While some authors
argue that each of these dimensions is an alternative
way to measure fidelity, it has been also argued that a
comprehensive picture of fidelity requires the measure-
ment of all the five dimensions [15].
Carroll et al. [15] proposed their conceptual framework
in an attempt to “attribute meaning ”to the concept of
fidelity, but also to clarify and explain the function of each
of the five classical fidelity dimensions and their rela-
tionship to one another. In their framework, they also
included two additional elements suggested by a broader
literature review on diffusion of innovations and on imple-
mentation fidelity: intervention complexity and facilitation
strategies. These are strategies put in place to optimize the
level of fidelity achieved.
For Carroll et al. [15], “the measurement of implementa-
tion fidelity is the measurement of adherence, i.e., how far
those responsible for delivering an intervention actually
adhere to the intervention as it is outlined by its designers.
Adherence includes the subcategories of content, fre-
quency, duration and coverage (i.e., dose). The degree to
which the intended content or frequency of an interven-
tion is implemented is the degree of implementationfidelity achieved for that intervention. The level achieved

tain other variables: intervention complexity, facilita-
tion strategies, quality of delivery, and participant
responsiveness ”(Fig. 1). The broken line in Fig. 1 indi-
cates that the relationship between an intervention and
its outcomes is external to implementation fidelity, but
that the degree of implementation fidelity achieved can
affect this relationship.
According to Carroll et al. [15], in the real world, an
intervention cannot be always fully implemented as
planned. An intervention may also be implemented
successfully, and meaningfully, if only its essential com-
ponents are implemented. An analysis of outcomes may
help to identify those components that are essential to
the intervention, if the intervention is to maintain its
intended effects. Outcome evaluation may also inform
the content of the intervention by determining the
minimum requirements for high implementation fidelity,
i.e., the essential components.
Carroll et al. [15] stated that identifying essential
components provides scope for adaptation but that the
question on how to identify what is essential remains
unanswered. They suggested that a possible way to
identify what is essential could be conducting sensitivity
or component analysis using implementation fidelity
data and performance outcomes from different studies
o ft h es a m ei n t e r v e n t i o n .
The implementation process and the need for adaptation
Dusenbury et al. [8] conducted a literature review on re-
search on the fidelity of implementation in different fields
(e. g., mental health, prevention of psychopathology, per-
sonal and social competence promotion, education, drug

abuse treatment and prevention) published over a 25-year
period. In this review, the authors discussed the tensions
between fidelity of implementation and the need for adap-
tation [8]. They concluded that research has not yet indi-
cated whether and under what conditions adaptation
might enhance program outcomes and under which con-
ditions it results in a loss of effectiveness.
Although there is a general agreement that adaptation
entails bringing changes to the original design of an inter-
vention [9 –15, 23 –26], there is no common agreement on
the definition of adaptation [9]. Restrictive definitions co-
exist with broader understandings. In restrictive defini-
tions, adaptations are limited to tailoring interventions to
local contexts and circumstances [5, 19, 20]. In a broader
sense, adaptation is the result of the cognitive processes
that occur while implementers or potential users struggle
to give meaning to an intervention during its implementa-
tion [23]. In this understanding of the term, originating
from diffusion of innovation theory scholars, this specific
type of adaptation, which goes further than simply adapt-
ing, is very often called reinvention . We situate ourselves
in this line of thinking.
Rogers [23], in his solid and well-articulated diffusion
of innovations theory, brings together central concepts
and issues regarding widespread implementation (e.g.,
dissemination, replication, sustai nability, institutionalization,
routinization, and fidelity) that have been discussed in
the literature at large [27 –3 1 ] .H i st h e o r yi sb u i l to n
observations of regularities and patterns in the diffusion
of a wide range of innovations (i.e., idea, practice, or
object that is perceived as new by its potential individ-
ual and organizational users), in different cultural contexts
with different users, as well as on a theoretical reflection
on the issue that extends over decades.
Diffusion of innovations theory dismantles some of the
arguments of early diffusion studies supporting the idea
that an innovation is an invariant, which does not change
throughout the diffusion process; and that potential users
are passive subjects that implement an innovation with fi-
delity, i.e., just as intended by its developers. In Rogers ’
view [23], reinvention (i.e., a specific type of adaptation) or
the degree to which an innovation is changed or modified
occurs at the implementation stage for many potential
users and leads to faster and sustainable adoption of the
innovation.
Bauman, Stein, and Ireys [25] introduced the idea of
program “uniqueness ”referring to the specifics and
unusual conditions under which programs are created
that are not present in actual implementation. This idea
brings us back to an understanding of “translating ”
evidence-based interventions as the art to achieve an
equivalent rather than a literal copy [2, 32]. Backer [11]
argued that adaptations of some features of innovative
interventions are inevitable, even desirable, to maintainthe theory-based outcomes. On the one hand, the in-
ability to modify programs may produce users ’resist-
ance. Besides, a rigid position regarding fidelity can
lead to innovations that are irrelevant or even inappro-
priate for certain users. Backer [11] also states that in-
terventions that are flexible and that can be adapted
h a v eab e t t e rc h a n c et of i taw i d e rr a n g eo fu s e r s .C e r -
tain users may have an aversion to simply “copying ”in-
terventions and pressurize for recognition of their
adaptations [11].
Furthermore, according to some authors [11, 33],
program fidelity is underpinned by a professionally
driven or “top-down ”approach to implementation,
while adaptation seems to be closer to a user-based or
“bottom-up ”approach, which is more politically appealing
to promoters of social development. Consequently, some
authors state that a certain amount of adaptation is
needed in order to achieve users ’involvement and owner-
ship for successful implementation of some innovations
[34, 35]. This is particularly relevant for adaptive interven-
tions. These require emphasizing the processes that per-
mit them to be modified and revised according to their
unfolding interaction within the institutional setting
and context [36]. This connects with the idea of mutual
adaptation , i.e., adaptation of both the intervention and
of the host organization [11, 36 –38], as organizational
changes will —need to —occur within the institutional
setting to accommodate the intervention [5].
If there is no agreement in the literature on defining
adaptation, another challenge is the lack of consensus
on how to operationalize these concepts [9]. Still, some
typologies are found in the literature [11, 24, 39].
Adaptations can be deliberate or accidental and include
(1) additions of new components; (2) deletions or radical
modifications to an intervention component in such a way
that it no longer resembles the original one; and (3)
minor or major modifications to an existing interven-
tion component [11, 24] (e.g., changes in the nature of
program components, in the manner or intensity of
administration, cultural mod ifications required by local
circumstances [11]). According to Rebchook et al. [24],
in theory, the implications of the above three kinds of
adaptations on fidelity are different. When adding
something new, fidelity can be easily maintained. When
a component is suppressed or radically modified, fidel-
i t yi st h r e a t e n e d .I nt h et h i r dc a s e ,d e p e n d i n gu p o n
what the modifications entail, it may or may not affect
fidelity. More recently, Stirman et al. [39] proposed an
elaborated framework for classifying modifications
brought to evidence-based programs or interventions.
It encompasses what is modified, by whom, at which
level of delivery, contextual modifications and the na-
ture of the modifications introduced in the content of
the intervention.Pérez et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:91 Page 4 of 11
In the literature, authors deal with adaptation in very
different ways. Bellg and colleagues do not take into con-
sideration adaptation and are exclusively concerned with
documenting, monitoring, and enhancing fidelity [16 –18].
For some authors such as Collins, Murphy, and Bierman
[19], adaptation of intervention options (e.g., dosage) can
only be decided upon by intervention developers and
follows a sequence of decision rules that recommend
when and how the intervention should be modified
with the aim to optimize long-term effectiveness. Other
authors [5, 40, 41] support the idea that interventions
should first be implemented with fidelity before allow-
ing for adaptation, in order to discriminate between
desirable and undesirable changes. Finally, for Carroll
et al. [15], adaptation is likely to occur, but they argue
that as far as essential components are not known, fi-
delity to the whole intervention is required.
We support the idea that fidelity and adaptation co-
exist [23]. From our point of view, adaptations can lead
either to improve on or to threaten the intervention ’s
underlying theory of change [42] and thus impact posi-
tively or negatively on effectiveness. For adaptive interven-
tions, research should answer the question how an
adequate fidelity-adaptation balance can be reached. One
way to address this issue is looking systematically at the
aspects of an intervention that are being adapted [12].
Our empirical research: fidelity-adaptation balance in the
implementation of an empowerment strategy
Dengue is a vector-borne disease that is transmitted by
anAedes mosquito infected with one of the four dengue
viruses [43, 44]. A mild episode of the disease can evolve
to a severe and fatal hemorrhagic illness [45]. The disease
is of growing public health importance in tropical and
subtropical areas [46]. All currently available control
methods target the Aedes mosquito, and it is nearly
impossible to implement them without community
acceptance or active involvement [47 –50].
Empowerment strategies have been reported as effect-
ive for community-based dengue prevention and control
in Cuba [51 –55] and elsewhere [56 –58]. Still, empower-
ment strategies remain controversial due to transferabil-
ity and scalability issues [59], and evidence available in
the literature on participatory implementation processes
is scarce [60].
We conducted in the Cuban context a fidelity assess-
ment of the implementation of an evidence-based em-
powerment strategy aiming at community involvement
in decision-making on dengue vector control activities
when it was replicated at intermediate scale [61]. The
empowerment strategy was developed by researchers
from the Pedro Kourí Institute of Tropical Medicine
(IPK) in Havana City. It was defined in terms of compo-
nents and subcomponents. The components were capacitybuilding, organization and management, community work,
and surveillance.
The strategy was implemented between October 2004
and December 2007 in 16 communities (circumscrip-
tions) randomly selected within three People ’s Councils
( P C s )i nL aL i s am u n i c i p a l i t yo fH a v a n aC i t y[ 5 5 ] .T h e
circumscription is the lowest level of local government
and covers about 1000 inhabitants. The PCs are inter-
mediate government structures between the municipal-
ities and the circumscriptions. Circumscriptions and
PCs were heterogeneous in terms of socio-demographic
composition of the population, previous experiences
with participation, character istics of the leadership, and
resources and dynamic of the local government, among
others.
In view of the adaptive nature of the strategy, we
anticipated that the classical fidelity dimensions would
be of limited use for assessing adaptations. We therefore
opted to assess fidelity and adaptation in the implemen-
tation of the strategy based on Rebchoock et al. ’s [24]
typology to determine implemented, not-implemented,
modified or added components, and subcomponents at
circumscription level.
A three-step assessment was conducted [61]: (1) an in-
dividual evaluation by three strategy developers involved
as facilitators in the implementation of the strategy,
based on the analysis of proceedings and minutes of
capacity-building workshops and process documentation
forms that were filled in by implementers (i.e., imple-
mentation descriptors of component/subcomponents of
the strategy for each circumscription); (2) a discussion of
these assessments by a broader group of strategy devel-
opers (the three from the first step and three additional
ones). If the six agreed that in a given circumscription, a
component or subcomponent of the strategy was imple-
mented as intended, it was classified as implemented. If
all agreed that a component or subcomponent was not
implemented, it was classified as such. If any of the pro-
fessionals judged that a component or subcomponent
was modified, it was classified as such. Added activities
were also identified; and (3) the assessment was consen-
sually refined following its discussion with implementers
in a participatory evaluation workshop.
Qualitative data obtained from the three-step assess-
ment were transformed into quantitative data [62]. Fre-
quencies of not-implemented, modified, and implemented
subcomponents were tabulated over all circumscriptions,
and the average was calculated for the four components.
To explore the relationships among the components, not-
implemented, modified, and implemented components of
the strategy were scored 0, 1, and 2, respectively, and their
values were summed for each circumscription. In
addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with
13 implementers and deductively analyzed to identifyPérez et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:91 Page 5 of 11
possible explanations for the observed variation in the im-
plementation of the strategy. The assessment was con-
ducted retrospectively, as part of the final evaluation of
the replication of the strategy. Table 1 provides a descrip-
tion of the empowerment strategy for dengue vector con-
trol carried out in La Lisa municipality by components
and subcomponents as well as the number of circumscrip-
tions that implemented as intended, modified, or did not
implement subcomponents.
Surveillance was the most implemented component
followed by capacity building. Community work and
organization and management were less implemented or
modified [61]. Even in the case of the more implemented
components, there were some subcomponents not imple-
mented. The more components and subcomponents were
innovative (i.e., those that implied activities which were
far-off from or disruptive of the routine vector control
practices and that could not be easily accommodated byimplementers ’expertise, previous experiences or know-
how), the less they were implemented.
Scarcely implemented subcomponents were internal
and external resource mobilization by the circumscrip-
tions, designing communication strategies, and develop-
ing local communication materials. Main modifications
introduced were the composition of CWGs, changing the
approach of the capacity building from participatory to
individualized and modifications to the design of the train-
ing activities such as using more adequate participatory
techniques adapted to the char acteristics of the partici-
pants. Within the whole strategy, some activities were
added such as linking the strategy with activities con-
ducted at primary school level, involving stakeholders
not initially foreseen, self- organizing additional com-
munity training workshops, and conducting strength
assessments as part of the participatory community
diagnosis.Table 1 The empowerment strategy for dengue vector control by components and subcomponents and the number of

The difficulties encountered during implementation
were related to appropriate training and skills, available
time, lack of support and commitment to the strategy
by the local government and health authorities, lack of
motivation of local leadership, and integration of actors
and resources. The study showed a wide variability of
fidelity in the implementation of the intervention. The
variability was largely explained by the complexity of
the strategy and the lack of knowledge on its basic
principles among the implementers .The variation in
implementation fidelity did not result in a substantial
loss of effectiveness [55]. More detailed information on
the methods used in our fidelity study and results are
provided in Pérez et al. 2010 [61].
Rebchook et al. ’s [24] typology proved suitable to
assess the fidelity-adaptation balance of the empower-
ment strategy, but had limitations. It did not allow us
to answer the question “which of the modifications
introduced in the strategy contributed to, or distracted
from, outcomes? ”Rebchook et al. ’s assertion that adding
new components or subcomponents to an original design
a priori does not threaten fidelity, is questionable; such
components could contradict the basic principles of the
intervention. Moreover, using Rebchook et al. ’s [24] typ-
ology, we could not provide a very detailed view of fidelity
in terms of content, dose, and coverage.
A modified Carroll et al. ’s framework for implementation
fidelity
Therefore, we confronted our empirical research with
existing literature on fidelity. As a result, we identified
Carroll et al. ’s [15] framework for implementation fidelityas the one that could potentially meet our concern of
assessing adaptation in the context of fidelity [33].
This framework, slightly modified by adding two
moderating factors (i.e., context and participant recruit-
ment), was empirically tested by Hasson et al. [63, 64]
in the evaluation of implementation fidelity of a com-
plex intervention in health and social care. Recently,
Gagliardi et al. [65] and von Thiele Schwarz et al. [12]
applied the conceptual framework to surgical safety check-
lists and occupational health interventions, respectively. In
all the above studies, the authors acknowledged that the
framework was a useful evaluation tool for implementa-
tion fidelity for complex interventions.
We propose a modified Carroll et al. ’s [15] framework
for implementation fidelit y that retains these authors
ideas of conducting outcome evaluation and component
analysis to identify those elements that are essential for an
intervention. Indeed, evaluating implementation efforts
and measuring the fidelity-adaptation balance have a
meaning only in the context of outcomes [11]. However,
we improved the graphical representation of the role of fi-
delity and outcome evaluations in identifying the essential
components of an intervention (Fig. 2).
We propose some major modifications to the frame-
work. Carroll et al. [15] established adherence as the sole
bottom-line measurement of implementation fidelity. As
we learned from our empirical fidelity research [61], the
nature of adaptations needs to be consciously captured
in relation to their effect on effectiveness. In the same
line, von Thiele et al. [12] recently suggested applying
Carroll et al. ’s subcategories of adherence (i.e., prescribed
content, frequency, duration, and coverage) to describe
and categorize adaptations. In addition, subcategories of
Fig. 2 Modified Carroll et al. ’s conceptual framework for implementation fidelityPérez et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:91 Page 7 of 11
adherence might not always be sufficient for every par-
ticular intervention; other aspects might be required.
Thus, in our adapted framework, we propose assessing
intervention specific descriptors of both fidelity and
adaptation, instead of fixed subcategories of adherence
alone. To move in this direction, intervention developers
need the following: first, to have a clear idea of the ex-
pected outcome(s); second, to make the functioning
principles or theory of change [42] of the intervention
explicit; third, to be able to state them in the form of
specific descriptors of fidelity; and fourth, to establish
questions to identify adaptations based on the descrip-
tion of the intervention. Intervention specific descriptors
of adaptation are developed through answering these
questions. A step further is to determine to what extent
the adaptations identified affect the functioning princi-
ples of a particular component and/or of the interven-
tion as a whole.
An example of this reasoning is provided using the
capacity-building component of our empowerment strat-
egy. The expected result was that the participants ac-
quire the knowledge and skills to change the existing
power relationships among them. The functioning prin-
ciples were rooted in the pedagogical model of popular
education [66]: the participants of the training need to
acquire specific knowledge and skills, these are provided
through a participatory learning process (learning
group); and the learning group has to involve stake-
holders who need to change their power relationships.
In Table 2, we provide specific descriptors of fidelity
for capacity building. These provide a comprehensive
description of the intervention as intended with details
on content, processes (e.g., “what, ”“how, ”“how fre-
quently, ”“to whom, ”and “by whom ”) and specifications
related to the implementation context. In Table 3, we
provide questions to identify if adaptations were brought
to the capacity-building component. Taking into ac-
count, the functioning principles of the component, only
the first adaptation identified distracts from the expected
result.
Through this analysis of the adaptations brought to an
intervention, avenues to prospectively improve imple-
mentation can be identified. The added value would be
to help intervention developers to identify those non-
pre-defined adaptations that could improve the design of
the intervention and, thus, effectiveness. Once a positive
adaptation is identified, the intervention could go
through a new cycle of designing, implementing, and
testing. This would require feedback mechanisms.
The need to further identify potential sources of vari-
ability in implementation has been highlighted by some
authors [67, 68], and Carroll et al. [15] themselves ac-
knowledged that the level of fidelity achieved is influ-
enced by potential moderating factors, which are notnecessarily independent. Hasson et al. [63, 64] further
emphasized the importance of other mechanisms and
factors influencing implementation fidelity while testing
Carroll et al. ’s framework. Our modified framework
maintains comprehensiveness of policy description,
quality of delivery, and participant responsiveness as
basic potential moderators, but permits to include
other setting- or situati on-specific moderators.
In addition, we agree with Carroll et al. [15] that fa-
cilitation strategies could influence potential modera-
tors of the level of fidelity achieved. For instance,
providing manuals and training to implementers could
improve the quality of the delivery of an intervention.
However, in our modified framework, those strategies are
put in place not with the purpose to increase “strict adher-
ence, ”but to contribute to achieve an adequate fidelity-
adaptation balance. Once adaptations and their positive or
negative effects have been identified, facilitation strategies
will only address those deemed as inadequate.
In the case of adaptive interventions, this also provides
scope for adaptation. The need for such an adequate
fidelity-adaptation balance, emphasized by Backer [11]
and von Thiele Schwarz et al. [12], is strongly supported
by the results of our empirical fidelity research [61] and
further research on diffusion of the empowerment
strategy for dengue prevention [69]. In practice, aiming
at a fidelity-adaptation balance implies interdependency
between fidelity and adaptation.
We also propose a further minor modification to
Carroll et al. ’s framework regarding the use of the termTable 2 Example of specific descriptors of fidelity for the capacity-
building component of the empowerment strategy for dengue
vector control. La Lisa municipality, Havana City, 2004 –2007
Specific descriptors of fidelity for capacity-building
What: development of knowledge and skills on four topics: (1) diagnosis,
group work, and participation; (2) surveillance of risks and
behaviors; (3) action plans and communication strategy; and (4)
participatory evaluation.
How: through a workshop based on the principles of the pedagogical
model of popular education: e.g., the objective is that the participants
think and, consequently, transform their reality, using a dialectic logic
between theory and practice and participatory and experience-based
learning methods.
How frequently: one 4-h workshop for each topic in a 3-month-span
period.
To whom: a learning group composed of three to five stakeholders
with different power relationships in relation to dengue vector
control activities, belonging to at least three communities.
By whom: facilitators previously trained based on the principles of
the pedagogical model of popular education.
Specifications related to the context: Three PCs are involved in the
project. There are five to six circumscriptions randomly selected per
PCs. Methodological support for the training is provided: e.g., written
guidelines on how to conduct a popular education workshop,
methodological counseling to the facilitators by at least one IPK ’s
strategy developer.Pérez et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:91 Page 8 of 11
intervention . Keeping in mind the controversial top-
down versus bottom-up approaches to implementation
[11, 33], intervention may be a suited term for a top-
down approach. Therefore, we consider that the term
adaptive intervention is more appropriate in our modi-
fied theoretical framework of implementation fidelity.
More empirical research is needed to test and validate
the modified framework, but we do believe that it may
permit a comprehensive assessment of the implementa-
tion fidelity-adaptation balance for adaptive interventions.
Conclusions
Translating into practice evidence-based interventions,
deals with unresolved tensions between the need for high
implementation fidelity to ensure interventions ’intended
effects and bringing changes to the original proposal to fit
potential users ’needs. We argue that the issue of fidelity
cannot be apprehended independently from the issue of
adaptation and that both concepts are intrinsically linked.
This paper proposes a conceptual framework of imple-
mentation fidelity modified from Carroll et al. [15]
suitable to assess the fidelity-adaptation balance for
adaptive interventions.
We retain Carroll et al. ’s ideas of identifying those el-
ements of an intervention that are essential to maintain
its intended effects. However, we propose assessing
intervention specific descriptors of both fidelity and
adaptation instead of fixed subcategories of adherence
alone. We argue that the assessment should capture the
nature of the adaptations that occur while implement-
ing adaptive interventions in relation to their effect on
effectiveness. Besides, the measurement of adherence
stricto sensu may not always be applicable to a particu-
lar intervention. We also sugg est that developing facili-
tation strategies could influence moderators of fidelity
and do not need to serve the purpose to optimize im-
plementation fidelity, but to achieve an adequate
fidelity-adaptation balance.
More empirical research is needed to test and validate
the modified framework, but we do believe that it may
permit a comprehensive assessment of the implementa-
tion fidelity-adaptation balance for adaptive interventions.

Questions to identify adaptations Specific descriptors of adaptation
for a PC
What: Was the content of the
training changed in any way?
How? Was any topic suppressed?
Which one? Why? Was any topic
replaced? By which one? Why? Was
any topic added? Which one?
Why?The topic “diagnosis, group work,
and participation ”was suppressed
of the content of the training
because it was deemed irrelevant
by the facilitators.
Monothematic workshops on
communication strategies were
added to facilitate the assimilation
by the participants of the topic.
How: Was any principle of the
pedagogical model adapted (e.g.,
objectives, logic, learning
methods)? Which one? How?
Why? Was the pedagogical model
replaced by another? By which one?
Why?Some of the learning methods
were adapted to the characteristics
of the participants. Reading
sessions were replaced by
interactive lectures to facilitate
the understanding of the topics.
How frequently: Was any
adaptation introduced in the
frequency of the training (e.g.,
number of sessions, number of
hours per sessions? How? Why?
Were the workshop ’s sessions split
over time? How? Why? Was there
any adaptation introduced in the
length of the span period intended
to provide the training? How?
Why?No adaptations (i.e., additions,
modifications, deletions) identified
To whom: Was the learning group
adapted in any way (e.g., quantity
of the participants, role of the
