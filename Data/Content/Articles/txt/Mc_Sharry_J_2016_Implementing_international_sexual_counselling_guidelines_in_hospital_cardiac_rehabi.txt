counselling guidelines in hospital cardiac
rehabilitation: development of the CHARMS
intervention using the Behaviour Change
Wheel
J. Mc Sharry*, P. J. Murphy and M. Byrne
Abstract
Background: Decreased sexual activity and sexual problems are common among people with cardiovascular
disease, negatively impacting relationship satisfaction and quality of life. International guidelines recommend
routine delivery of sexual counselling to cardiac patients. The Cardiac Health and Relationship Management and
Sexuality (CHARMS) baseline study in Ireland found, similar to international findings, limited implementation of
sexual counselling guidelines in practice. The aim of the current study was to develop the CHARMS multi-level
intervention to increase delivery of sexual counselling by healthcare professionals. We describe the methods used
to develop the CHARMS intervention following the three phases of the Behaviour Change Wheel approach:
understand the behaviour, identify intervention options, and identify content and implementation options. Survey
(n= 60) and focus group ( n= 14) data from two previous studies exploring why sexual counselling is not currently
being delivered were coded by two members of the research team to understand staff ’s capability, opportunity,
and motivation to engage in the behaviour. All potentially relevant intervention functions to change behaviour
were identified and the APEASE (affordability, practicability, effectiveness, acceptability, side effects and equity)
criteria were used to select the most appropriate. The APEASE criteria were then used to choose between all
behaviour change techniques (BCTs) potentially relevant to the identified functions, and these BCTs were translated
into intervention content. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist was used to
specify details of the intervention including the who, what, how and where of proposed intervention delivery.
Results: Providing sexual counselling group sessions by cardiac rehabilitation staff to patients during phase III
cardiac rehabilitation was identified as the target behaviour. Education, enablement, modelling, persuasion and
training were selected as appropriate intervention functions. Twelve BCTs, linked to intervention functions, were
identified for inclusion and translated into CHARMS intervention content.
Conclusions: This paper details the use of Behaviour Change Wheel approach to develop an implementation
intervention in an under-researched area of healthcare provision. The systematic and transparent development of
the CHARMS intervention will facilitate the evaluation of intervention effectiveness and future replication and
contribute to the advancement of a cumulative science of implementation intervention design.

Background
The gap between what we know and what we do ,b e t w e e n
research evidence and clinical practice, is a consistent
feature of healthcare delivery [1, 2]. Changing healthcare
professional behaviour to implement evidence-based
guidelines into routine practice is a major challenge within
the time and resource constraints of the healthcare sys-
tem. Implementing guidelines for sensitive topics, such as
sexuality, can be particularly difficult with healthcare pro-
fessionals ’discomfort and fear of causing offence acting as
additional barriers to changing patient care [3]. Obstacles
to implementation can arise at multiple levels within the
healthcare system: from the individual patient to the wider
environment [4].
Multi-level interventions are interventions targeted at
several levels, for example, individual patients, groups,
and organisations [5]. Implementation interventions, to
improve the update of evidence into practice, can be
understood as multi-level interventions that require pa-
tient, provider, system and environmental level change
[6]. The overall goal of implementation interventions is
to enhance care at a patient level to improve patient
outcomes. Implementing evidence into practice often re-
quires intervention at the provider level to support
healthcare professionals to modify established patterns
of care. Ensuring sustainability requires interventions to
be integrated at a system level and to work within
healthcare infrastructures for adoption into routine care.
Finally, at an environmental level , the widespread adop-
tion of new practices requires the development of policy
frameworks that embed implementation at a national or
international level.
Recent years have seen advancements in behavioural
science of particular relevance to the healthcare pro-
fessional behaviour change at the heart of provider level
interventions [7]. Systematic guidance and lists of behav-
ioural techniques provide tools to develop theory-based
behaviour change interventions, detail the mechanisms
through which change is expected to occur and describe
intervention content using shared terminology [8, 9].
The current study explores the use of these tools and
techniques to develop a multi-level implementation inter-
vention to promote the provision of sexual counselling to
cardiac patients.
Sexual counselling is an under-researched aspect of
healthcare provision. Sexual d ysfunction among patients
with cardiovascular disease is common, and return to
sexual activity after a cardiac event is challenging [10, 11].
Sexual problems can have far-reaching and negative conse-
quences on psychological well-being, relationship satisfac-
tion and quality of life [12, 13]. There is evidence that
sexual counselling can reduce sexual problems and improve
sexual function [14]. The World Health Organization has
rated the evidence that brief sexuality-related counselling ismore effective than usual care in reducing sexual difficulties
as strong [15]. Sexual counselling for cardiac patients aims
to assess existing sexual problems, provide information on
concerns and support safe return to sexual activity after a
cardiac event or procedure [16]. A consensus document en-
dorsed by the American Heart Association and European
Society of Cardiology recommends routine assessment of
sexual problems and sexual coun selling for all individuals
with cardiovascular disease [17, 18]. Despite consensus
guidelines, and evidence of patient need, discussions be-
tween patients and providers about sexual activity rarely
take place in practice [19].
Exploring the healthcare context is recommended for
the effective implementation of guidelines into practice
[6]. In Ireland, the Cardiac Health and Relationship
Management and Sexuality (CHARMS) baseline study
surveyed nationally representative samples of patients,
general practitioners and cardiac rehabilitation staff
about sex and cardiovascular disease [20]. In line with
international evidence, Irish cardiac patients reported
high rates of sexual problems; nearly double the rate for
age-matched non-cardiac samples [21]. Patients recog-
nised the need for support, with the majority interested
in receiving sexual education and counselling. This need
was not being met; two thirds of patients reported that
sex had never been addressed by their healthcare pro-
vider, and when addressed, satisfaction with the manner
of provision was low [21]. General practitioners reported
rarely discussing sexual concerns with cardiac patients
[22], and cardiac rehabilitation staff reported a lack of
specific assessment and counselling guidance within
their service [23].
We aimed to develop the CHARMS complex multi-
level intervention to address the poor implementation of
evidence-based guidelines to provide sexual counselling
to cardiac patients in Ireland. The overall aims of the
CHARMS intervention were to:
–Improve sexuality-related outcomes for patients
with cardiac disease (patient level)
–Increase provision of sexual counselling by
healthcare providers (provider level)
–Develop a sustainable pathway for the delivery
of sexual counselling within the Irish healthcare
system (system level)
As there are very few examples of documented sexual
counselling interventions and existing examples are poorly
described [24], we chose to take a systematic approach to
intervention development and description. The Behaviour
Change Wheel (BCW) is a framework for designing inter-
ventions developed by synthesising 19 existing behaviour
change frameworks [8]. Step-by-step guidance on the use
ofthe BCW in the systematic design of interventions hasMc Sharry et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:134 Page 2 of 11
been outlined and linked to the UK Medical Research
Council (MRC) guidance for the development of complex
interventions [25, 26]. At the centre of the BCW is the
Capability Opportunity Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B)
model, a means to understand behaviour in context. Un-
derstanding the behaviour of health professionals in con-
text facilitates the development of interventions to target
barriers to change that behaviour. Tailoring interventions
to overcome context-specific barriers has been shown to
improve care delivery and patient outcomes [27].
The COM-B model describes behaviour as an inter-
action between an individual ’s capability, opportunity
and motivation to engage in the behaviour. Capability is
the individual ’s ability to perform a behaviour and in-
cludes both physical capability (e.g. skills) and psycho-
logical capability (e.g. knowledge). Opportunity describes
the factors that lie outside the individual that facilitate
or prompt behaviour and includes both physical oppor-
tunity (e.g. affordability) and social opportunity (e.g. cul-
tural norms). Motivation describes the brain processes
that energise and direct behaviour and includes both
automatic motivation (e.g. habits) and reflective motiv-
ation (e.g. cost-benefit decision making). The BCW links
COM-B components to nine intervention functions (co-
ercion, education, enablement, environmental restruc-
turing, incentivisation, modelling, persuasion, restriction,
training), through which an intervention can change
behaviour, and seven broad policy categories (communi-
cation/marketing, environmental/social planning, fiscal
measures, guidelines, legislation, regulation, service
provision) describing the decisions authorities can make
to support delivery of intervention functions [28].
The BCW approach links intervention functions to be-
haviour change techniques (BCTs), the observable, replic-
able and irreducible active ingredients of an intervention,
outlined in the BCT Taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1), a structured
list of BCTs [29]. The agreed labels and definitions in-
cluded in the BCTTv1 allow intervention content to be
clearly described using standard terminology [9, 29]. Exist-
ing studies have used the BCW, the COM-B model and
BCT taxonomies to develop and describe implementation
interventions in healthcare settings [26, 30, 31].
This paper describes the methods used to develop the
CHARMS intervention to increase the provision of sexual
counselling to cardiac rehabilitation patients in Ireland
following the BCW approach. By describing the use of the
BCW to implement international guidelines in practice,
we hope to provide guidance for future implementation
intervention designers and to reflect on the usefulness of
the BCW in the development of implementation interven-
tions. The main target of behaviour change was at the
provider level, to increase the provision of sexual counsel-
ling by healthcare professionals. However, as changing
provider behaviour requires patient level interaction andsystem level integration, the multi-level nature of the
intervention was considered throughout development.
Methods
We used the BCW to guide intervention development.
BCW guidance provides a step-by-step method for de-
signing behaviour change interventions and outlines three
phases in the intervention design process: understand the
behaviour, identify intervention options and identify con-
tent and intervention options [28].
Phase 1: Understand the behaviour
Phase 1 describes four steps that lay the ground work
for understanding the target behaviour: define the prob-
lem in behavioural terms, select the target behaviour,
specify the target behaviour and identify what needs to
change.
Step 1: Define the problem in behavioural terms
Step 1 requires describing the problem of interest as a
behaviour and specifying the target group involved and
the behaviour itself. We used guideline recommenda-
tions [17, 18] and documented evidence-practice gaps in
Ireland [21, 23, 32] to define the problem in behavioural
terms.
Step 2: Select target behaviour
Step 2 describes generating a long list of potential candi-
date behaviours and selecting a target behaviour by con-
sidering each behaviour in terms of potential impact,
likelihood of change, spillover effect and ease of measure-
ment. We did not engage with this step in the process, as
the target behaviour was pre-determined from inter-
national guidelines.
Step 3: Specify the target behaviour
We followed BCW guidance to specify the target behav-
iour in appropriate detail and in context by answering
the following questions: What is the behaviour that will
be targeted for change? Who performs the behaviour?
When and where do they perform the behaviour? In an-
swering these questions to specify provider level behav-
iour change, we maintained a system level awareness of
the reality of Irish healthcare. We answered these ques-
tions with reference to published recommendations on
the delivery of sexual counselling to individuals with car-
diovascular disease [17, 18]. We identified the setting for
our implementation intervention through a system-level
consideration of the most sustainable method of delivery
within Irish healthcare and by incorporating the views of
patients, general practitioners and cardiac rehabilitation
staff elicited during the CHARMS baseline studies [32].Mc Sharry et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:134 Page 3 of 11
Step 4: Identify what needs to change
We used two of the CHARMS baseline studies to under-
stand why the target behaviour was not currently being
carried out and to identify what needs to change: a
nationally representative quantitative survey of cardiac
rehabilitation staff ( n= 60) views of sexual counselling
[23] and a qualitative study of staff ( n= 14) experiences
of discussing sexual issues with patients [32]. From the
quantitative survey, endorsed attitudes and beliefs and
perceived barriers to the provision of sexual counselling
were extracted, as were self-ratings of knowledge, con-
fidence and awareness in relation to sexual counselling.
From the qualitative study, reported barriers from
focus group data were extracted. Data from both stud-
ies were then coded to COM-B model components by
PM and JMS.
Phase 2: Identify intervention options
Phase 2 describes two steps to guide selection of inter-
vention options: identify intervention functions, the
broad categories through which an intervention can
change behaviour, and identify policy categories to sup-
port the delivery of the identified functions.
Step 5: Identify intervention functions
We identified potentially relevant intervention functions
by linking the COM-B components relevant to why sex-
ual counselling is not currently being carried out, with
intervention functions as per published guidance on the
use of the BCW [8]. We then used the APEASE (afford-
ability, practicability, effectiveness and cost effectiveness,
acceptability, side effects/safety and equity) criteria to se-
lect the most appropriate intervention functions for our
intervention [28].
Step 6: Identify policy categories
BCW guidance suggests which policy categories are
likely to be appropriate and effective in supporting dif-
ferent intervention functions. For each intervention
function identified in step 5, we listed the policy categor-
ies suggested in BCW guidance. We then identified the
policy categories common across our included interven-
tion functions and selected those we believed to be most
applicable to the cardiac rehabilitation setting [28].
Phase 3: Identify content and implementation options
Phase 3 describes two steps to specify intervention con-
tent in more detail in terms of BCTs and to identify the
mode of delivery for the intervention.
Step 7: Identify behaviour change techniques
We used the labels and detailed definitions included in
the BCTTv1 [9] to identify BCTs. We took the interven-
tion functions identified during step 5 and prepared aninitial long list of potential BCTs using published guid-
ance mapping BCTs to intervention functions [28]. BCTs
that did not meet the APEASE criteria within the con-
text of cardiac rehabilitation were excluded, and the
most appropriate BCTs were shortlisted by JMS, PM and
MB separately. We decided on final BCT inclusion
through group discussion.
Step 8: Identify mode of delivery
JMS, PM and MB first separately brainstormed the best
ways to translate BCT into intervention content and
then met to discuss and agree on content. We used the
Template for Intervention Description and Replication
(TIDieR) checklist to specify details of the intervention
including the who, what, how and where of proposed
intervention delivery [33].
Results
Phase 1: Understand the behaviour
Step 1: Define the problem in behavioural terms
The healthcare problem was the gap between current
practice identified in the published literature [21, 23, 32]
and international consensus guidelines to deliver sexual
counselling to people with cardiovascular disease [17].
We identified increased delivery of sexual counselling as
the behaviour to be targeted to address the problem.
Step 2: Select target behaviour
We did not identify a long list of candidate behaviours
and select one as outlined in BCW guidance. Instead,
international guidelines provided the target behaviour:
the delivery of sexual counselling by healthcare profes-
sionals to people with cardiovascular disease.
Step 3: Specify the target behaviour
What is the behaviour that will be targeted for change?
The delivery of sexual counselling to people with car-
diovascular disease was the behaviour targeted for
change.
When and where is the behaviour performed? Find-
ings from the CHARMS baseline indicated that all
stakeholders considered cardiac rehabilitation to be an
appropriate setting for the delivery of sexual counsel-
ling [32]. Further specification of the target behaviour
required an understanding of the format of Irish car-
diac rehabilitation. There are 37 cardiac rehabilitation
centres in Ireland which operate as units within a hos-
pital. Cardiac rehabilitation is managed and delivered
by a cardiac rehabilitation co-ordinator supported by a
range of healthcare providers, including cardiologists,
physiotherapists, nurses, occupational therapists, dieti-
cians, pharmacists, psychologists and social workers.Mc Sharry et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:134 Page 4 of 11
There are four phases of cardiac rehabilitation, and each
was considered as a potential implementation setting for
the CHARMS intervention. Phase 1, hospitalisation fol-
lowing an acute cardiac event, was deemed unsuitable as
patients may be too sick, and treatment too intensive,
for the delivery of sexual counselling. Phase 2, the imme-
diate post-discharge period, was also deemed not suit-
able as it is generally unstructured, variable in length,
and input from health professionals may be minimal.
Phase 3, structured exercise and education programmes
delivered by cardiac rehabilitation staff in hospital out-
patient units, was deemed to be suitable because (1) pa-
tients at this stage are engaged in a return to usual
activities, including sex; (2) the intervention could be in-
tegrated into existing structured programmes; and (3)
the intervention could be delivered by cardiac rehabilita-
tion staff rather than by researchers, thus making the
implementation sustainable. Phase 4, the on-going main-
tenance of lifestyle changes enacted in previous phases,
was deemed to be unsuitable given the lack of structure
and uncertain input from healthcare professionals.
International guidelines do not specify whether sexual
counselling should be delivered on a one-to-one or
group basis. However, as cardiac rehabilitation sessions
are currently group-based, group delivery was chosen as
the most feasible and sustainable delivery method. The
potential spillover effects from group delivery was also
promising as group discussion may facilitate the normal-
isation of sexual issues and empower patients to request
one-to-one advice if needed.
Who performs the behaviour? As cardiac rehabilitation
can be delivered by different healthcare providers in dif-
ferent centres, the type of healthcare provider was not
specified at this stage.
By answering the questions provided in BCW guidance,
the target behaviour was specified as the provision of sex-
ual counselling group sessions by cardiac rehabilitation
healthcare staff to all patients aged 18 or older with car-
diovascular disease during phase III cardiac rehabilitation
in hospital centres in the Republic of Ireland.
Step 4: Identify what needs to change
By using the COM-B model to understand why sexual
counselling is not currently being delivered by cardiac
rehabilitation staff, we identified psychological capabil-
ity, social opportunity, reflective motivation and auto-
matic motivation as potentially important COM-B
components to target. A su mmary of the identified
barriers and associated COM-B components is pro-
vided in Table 1.
Psychological capability Both survey and focus group
data indicated that staff felt they did not have thepsychological capability to deliver sexual counselling and
reported limited knowledge, awareness and information
about sexual issues in cardiovascular disease and inad-
equate training in the skills required to deliver sexual
counselling [23, 32].
Social opportunity A number of social opportunity fac-
tors impacted on staff inclination to deliver sexual coun-
selling to particular patient groups [32]. Older age was
seen to be a barrier, with younger patients perceived to
be more comfortable with discussions of sexuality. Male
patients were seen to treat the discussion of sex in a
jocular fashion; groups including women were seen to
be more serious which may limit open discussion. A
number of barriers particular to the delivery of sexual
counselling to women were also discussed. Women were
described as being unlikely to raise the topic of sexuality
and to actively avoid cardiac rehabilitation sessions
where sexuality would be discussed. Staff were also more
reluctant to discuss sex with women as they believed
older female patients had no experience or desire to
discuss their sex lives with health professionals. Sexual
dysfunction was also seen as more problematic and
time-consuming for women, and to have fewer referral
pathways available.
Social opportunity was also reflected in the issues
around ethnicity, culture, language and religion identi-
fied as barriers to sexual counselling delivery in both the
focus group and survey studies [23, 32]. Staff felt the dis-
cussion of sexual functioning might cause offence to
some ethnic populations, or that staff from different cul-
tural backgrounds may find the delivery of sexual coun-
selling more difficult.
Reflective motivation Perceived lack of patient readi-
ness, not viewing assessment and counselling as a staff
responsibility, and low staff confidence in their ability to
deliver sexual counselling were identified as additional
barriers across patient types [23].
Automatic motivation The perceived difficulties in dis-
cussing sexual issues with patients also lead to negative
emotional reactions to the delivery of sexual counselling
that fall within the category of automatic motivation. In
focus groups with cardiac staff, a sense of embarrass-
ment and a fear of offending were two of the most fre-
quently cited barriers to the discussion of sexuality [32]
and discomfort with sexual matters was identified as a
barrier in the staff survey [23].

vant to the COM-B components identified. The use ofMc Sharry et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:134 Page 5 of 11

the APEASE criteria to determine the most relevant
intervention functions within the context of phase 3
hospital cardiac rehabilitation in Ireland is shown in
Additional file 1. Based on our application of the
APEASE criteria, we selected education, enablement,
modelling, persuasion and training as the most appro-
priate intervention functions.
Step 6: Identify policy categories
All seven policy categories were identified as poten-
tially appropriate using BC W guidance, across the five
intervention functions identified in step 5. Guidelines,
regulation, legislation and service provision were common
across at least four of the five included intervention func-
tions. As regulation and legislation change were beyond
the scope of our intervention, we identified guidelines and
service provision as the two policy categories most rele-
vant to the CHARMS intervention.
Phase 3: Identify content and implementation options
Step 7: Identify behaviour change techniques
The initial long list of BCTs matched to intervention func-
tions, and the initial selection of potential BCTs using the
APEASE criteria, are shown in Additional file 2. From this
list of potential BCTs, we selected 12 BCTs as the most
appropriate following group discussion. Details of the se-
lected BCTs linked to barriers and intervention functions
are shown in Table 1.Step 8: Identify mode of delivery
For mode of delivery, the items included in the TIDieR
checklist provided a guide to the specification of the
planned delivery of intervention content. The completed
TIDieR checklist is shown in Additional file 3.
The CHARMS implementation intervention
The CHARMS implementation intervention consists of
the delivery of the 12 BCTs to all cardiac rehabilitation
healthcare providers as a face-to-face group intervention
lasting approximately 2 h. The translation of chosen
BCTs into intervention content is shown in Table 1. The
intervention will be delivered by a CHARMS educator.
Grimshaw et al. (2011) highlight the importance of cred-
ibility and suggest that the most appropriate person to
deliver an implementation intervention varies according
to the target audience [34]. The four criteria set for the
CHARMS educator were as follows:
1. Be from a health profession currently represented
within usual cardiac rehabilitation
2. Have experience with dealing with sexual issues
among patients with cardiovascular disease
3. Be experienced in cardiac rehabilitation
4. Be able to advise on acceptability or feasibility
issues with the intervention and study protocol
The CHARMS intervention delivered by the CHARMS
educator will support staff to deliver a 30-min group-Table 1 Barriers to sexual counselling delivery, COM-B components, selected intervention functions, selected BCTs and BCT translation

based sexual counselling session to patients within the
cardiac rehabilitation programme. Here again, a system-
level consideration was important as not all cardiac
rehabilitation centres work in exactly the same way. For
example, the number of staff and the length of the re-
habilitation programme can vary, as can the number of
patient groups running at any one time. Therefore, sexual
counselling delivery needs to be integrated into the re-
habilitation programme at each centre in a flexible way.
The CHARMS educator will discuss, agree and document
with staff details of the integration of group sexual coun-
selling into the routine cardiac rehabilitation programme.
Staff will be provided with an intervention manual
(with content linked to BCTs defined in the BCTTv1)
which includes additional detail to support the interven-
tion content delivered by the CHARMS educator and
step-by-step guidance on the delivery of sexual counsel-
ling at the patient level. Staff will also be provided with
an information booklet for patients containing informa-
tion on the resumption of sexual activity after a cardiac
event and suggestions about how to deal with problems
when they arise. Partners of patients will be invited to
attend the session in line with international guidance
[17, 18]. Study posters will also be displayed in the par-
ticipating cardiac rehabilitation centres to reassure pa-
tients that a return to sexual activity after a cardiac
event is normal and to encourage patients to seek advice
from staff if they have a sexual problem.
Discussion
This paper describes the methods used to systematically
develop the multi-level CHARMS implementation inter-
vention to increase uptake of sexual counselling delivery
guidelines by hospital cardiac rehabilitation staff in
Ireland. The paper addresses a clear evidence-practice
gap in the delivery of sexual counselling and describes a
transparent intervention development process informed
by focus group and survey data from cardiac rehabilitation
staff and patients. The paper extends behavioural science
methodology by using the BCW to develop an interven-
tion in an under-researched and sensitive area of health-
care provision, the delivery of sexual counselling during
cardiac rehabilitation. Our use of a systematic approach,
identification of mechanisms of action and description of
intervention content using standard terminology will
allow the CHARMS intervention, whether effective or
not, to contribute to the cumulative science of implemen-
tation intervention development. The paper also provides
a worked example and a reflection on the application of
the BCW to implementation intervention development,
which may be useful for other researchers.
Reflections on the BCW approach We found that the
BCW provided a useful framework to move from ourinitial exploratory research in the area of sexuality and
health services for people with cardiovascular disease to-
wards intervention formulation, particularly at the pro-
vider level. Michie and colleagues [28] suggest that the
major strength of the BCW approach is that it encour-
ages intervention designers to consider the full range of
options and to choose the most promising through a
systematic evaluation of theory and evidence. Our ex-
perience supports this suggestion, and the BCW ap-
proach allowed us to identify all potentially relevant
intervention functions and BCTs and to select the most
appropriate. The use of the BCT taxonomy allowed us
to specify content in detail, using agreed labels and defi-
nitions. We found the use of standardised terminology
and pre-determined phases of the development process
to be invaluable in facilitating discussion within the re-
search team.
Guidance for taking a systematic approach to design-
ing interventions is also provided by frameworks other
than the BCW. Intervention mapping, for example, out-
lines an alternative approach to developing theory- and
evidence-based health promotion programmes [35]. One
of the strengths we identified in our use of the BCW is
the simplicity and coherence of the COM-B model at
the core. A systematic review of the extent of use of the-
ory in implementation research found that only 53 of
235 studies (22.5 %) had employed theories [36]. A trad-
itional issue with theory, particularly when working in a
multi-disciplinary team, is the difficulty in selecting the
most appropriate theory from a potentially long list of
options [37]. COM-B provides a simplified framework
suitable for application to behaviour in any setting.
We found some of the initial steps to define and select
the target behaviour to be less fundamental to the devel-
opment of our intervention. Although we have outlined
all of the steps included in BCW guidance in the current
study, in reality, international guidelines provided the
target behaviour: the delivery of sexual counselling by
healthcare professionals to people with cardiovascular
disease. The target behaviour may be pre-specified in
other implementation interventions designed to sup-
port uptake of guidelines in to practice or be decided a
priori in funding applications to support intervention
development.
We identified some potential ambiguities in the use of
the COM-B model to identify what needs to change to
alter behaviour, as exploratory data could potentially be
coded in different ways. For example, barriers identified
by staff around patient lack of readiness could be coded
as social opportunity if seen as a reflection of the reality
of Irish social and cultural norms. However, studies with
patients contradict staff perceptions, as patients report a
desire for sexual issues to be raised by their healthcare
professional [32]. Accordingly, perceived lack of patientMc Sharry et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:134 Page 8 of 11
readiness may be best understood as a staff member ’s
personal evaluations of the situation, rather than reality,
and be coded as reflective motivation within the COM-B
model. Multiple perspectives are an inherent characteris-
tic of multi-level implementation interventions, and
more examples of how approaches such as the BCW can
be applied across patient, provider, system and environ-
mental levels of change would be helpful in navigating
the complexities of real-world implementation.
Further guidance on the translation of BCTs into
intervention content would also be helpful. Although
this is covered to some extent in BCW guidance under
mode of delivery in phase 3 [28], a more explicit thor-
ough approach to the specification of proposed interven-
tion delivery should be encouraged. We found the
TIDieR checklist [33] to be a useful tool to help specify
details of proposed intervention delivery including by
who, how and where the intervention would be delivere-
d,and recommend its use as an additional phase in the
BCW approach.
The BCW includes seven broad policy categories that
can be used to leverage behaviour change. In line with
other published examples, we found the selection of pol-
icy level categories less well defined and practical than
the other BCW steps [26, 30]. This recurring difficulty
in identifying policy categories may reflect an issue with
how policy is currently represented as part of the BCW
approach. The identification of policy categories is cur-
rently described as step 6 of the BCW process, between
the identification of intervention functions and the identi-
fication of BCTs. In practice, we found the identification
of intervention functions to flow logically to the selection
of BCTs, without the identification of policy categories.
For implementation interventions, the policy level may be
better represented as a broader over-arching aspect of the
process, more in line with the consideration of the envir-
onmental level of implementation than a discreet step in
intervention development to change healthcare profes-
sional behaviour.
Limitations In the current study, three members of
the core research team were involved in moving
through the phases outlined in the BCW guidance and
our multi-disciplinary st eering committee approved
the final intervention content. Previous published ex-
amples have organised expert workshops or multi-
disciplinary consensus meet ings structured around the
BCW [26, 38]. The lack of healthcare professional and
patient input into our BCW intervention development
process is a limitation of the current study. The CHARMS
intervention is currently being pilot tested in two cardiac
rehabilitation centres and the views of healthcare profes-
sionals, and patients/partners, on the feasibility and ac-
ceptability of the CHARMS intervention will be collectedvia questionnaires and interviews and be used for the fur-
ther refinement of the intervention [39]. The CHARMS
educator will also feed into the intervention refinement
process. Although a limitation, the current study demon-
strates that the BCW can be used to support systematic
intervention development even when resources to support
larger expert consensus consultation are not available.
The time and funding investment required to take a sys-
tematic approach to intervention development has been
previously noted [26, 30, 31], and the current study pro-
vides an example of the use of the BCW approach on a
slightly less resource-intensive scale.
We used the COM-B model to understand why sexual
counselling is not currently being carried out, rather
than the more detailed Theoretical Domains Framework
[40] which has previously been used in the development
of theory-informed implementation interventions using
the BCW approach [31]. One previous study compared
the use of both COM-B and the Theoretical Domains
Framework and concluded that similar associations be-
tween identified barriers, intervention functions and
BCTs were found using both methods [26]. We found
that the COM-B provided a sufficient framework for de-
veloping our intervention but that at times referring to
the more detailed constructs included in the Theoretical
Domains Framework, which have been linked to the
COM-B components, was useful in clarifying uncertainty
when moving through the BCW process.
Implications for research and practice The current
study highlights the import ance of preliminary research
with key stakeholders in the design of implementation
interventions. The BCW approach provides a frame-
work for intervention development, but requires the
u s eo fs u b j e c t i v ej u d g e m e n ta te v e r yp h a s e .D a t ac o l -
lected as part of the CHARMS baseline were vital to in-
form our decisions throughout the intervention
development and provided a consistent reminder of
the reality of the Irish cardiac rehabilitation health-
care context. Exploratory work with stakeholders may
be particularly important for sensitive topics, such as
sexuality, to identify pote ntial emotional and social
barriers to implementation.
Use of the COM-B model, and linking COM-B compo-
nents to intervention functions and specific BCTs, allowed
us to explicitly outline the proposed mechanisms of action
of the CHARMS intervention. Investigating these hypothe-
sised mechanisms of action, and whether included BCTs
are effective, requires a rigorous evaluation of the interven-
tion. A detailed evaluation, including an economic evalu-
ation and assessment of intervention feasibility and fidelity,
is planned for the CHARMS intervention. Provider and
patient level outcomes and staff capability, opportunity
and motivation for providing sexual counselling in cardiacMc Sharry et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:134 Page 9 of 11
rehabilitation pre- and post-intervention will be measured.
Further detail on the planned intervention evaluation is
provided in the protocol for the CHARMS implementation
intervention pilot study [39].
Although the benefits of systematic intervention devel-
opment are generally accepted [41], the question as to
whether using the BCW and other systematic ap-
proaches increases the effectiveness of interventions has
not yet been addressed. With the recent publication of a
number of examples of interventions developed using
the BCW approach [26, 30, 38], the time may now be
ripe to explore the acceptability, feasibility and effective-
ness of interventions developed using the BCW relative
to other interventions.
The environmental level of implementation was not
addressed in the current study. If, in a future ran-
domised controlled trial, we demonstrate that the
CHARMS intervention is effective, the widespread im-
plementation of the CHARMS intervention would re-
quire further development at an environmental level.
The Irish Association of Cardiac Rehabilitation (IACR)
is a multi-disciplinary group supported by the Irish
Heart Foundation, a national heart disease and stroke
charity. The IACR aims to increase awareness and un-
derstanding of cardiac rehabilitation in Ireland, improve
the standard of professional education, promote an
evidence-based approach to client care and facilitate
communication and support between cardiac rehabilita-
tion multi-disciplinary professionals. If the CHARMS
intervention is shown to be effective and feasible, the
research team will work with the IACR to establish
how best to incorporate the intervention at an environ-
mental level into national cardiovascular rehabilitation
policy and training frameworks.
Conclusions
The BCW approach provides a systematic, explicit and
pragmatic framework for implementation intervention
development. Additional guidance on the translation of
BCTs into intervention content and a re-consideration
of the representation of policy within the BCW may
increase the usefulness of the approach. Additional ex-
amples of how the BCW can be applied across environ-
mental, system, provider and patient levels would also
be helpful to inform future development of complex im-
plementation interventions.
