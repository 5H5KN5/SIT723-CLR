Abstract
Objective: Mindfulness interventions have been shown to reduce stress; however, the 
mechanisms driving stress resilience effects are not known. Mindfulness interventions aim to teach 
individuals how to: (i) use attention to monitor  present moment experiences; with (ii) an attitude of 
acceptance  and equanimity. A randomized controlled dismantling trial (RCT) was conducted to 
test the prediction that the removal of acceptance skills training would eliminate stress-reduction 
benefits of a mindfulness intervention.
Methods: This pre-registered RCT randomly assigned stressed community adults to one of three 
conditions: (i) Monitor & Accept (MA) mindfulness training, a standard 8-week MBSR 
intervention that provided explicit instruction in developing both monitoring and acceptance skills; 
(ii) Monitor Only (MO) mindfulness training, a well-matched 8-week MBSR intervention that 
taught monitoring skills only; or (iii) No Treatment (NT) control. Stress and non-judgment were 
measured using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for three days at baseline and three days 
at post-intervention.
Results: Consistent with predictions, MA participants increased in non-judgment and decreased 
in both stress ratings and the proportion of assessments that they reported experiencing feelings of 
stress in daily life, relative to both MO and NT participants.
Conclusions: This RCT provides one of the first experimental tests of the mechanisms linking 
mindfulness interventions with stress resilience. These findings suggest that acceptance skills 
training may be a necessary active ingredient and support the value of integrating acceptance skills 
training into stress-reduction interventions.

There has been a dramatic increase in research examining mindfulness training programs 
over the past twenty years. Over 350 mindfulness randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have 
been published in the previous decade alone (2006–2016; Creswell, 2017 ). One possible 
reason for this widespread interest is that mindfulness interventions have shown promise for 
improving a broad range of mental and physical health outcomes ( Creswell, 2017 ; Kuyken 
et al., 2016 ; Ludwig & Kabat-Zinn, 2008 ). One pathway through which mindfulness 
interventions are thought to produce these salutary effects is by buffering individuals against 
the negative consequences of stress ( Creswell & Lindsay, 2014 ). Consistent with this 
possibility, mindfulness interventions such as the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction 
(MBSR; Kabat-Zinn, 1990 ) program have consistently been shown to decrease self-reported 
distress and stress post-intervention (meta-analysis by Khoury, Sharma, Rush, & Fournier, 
2015 ). Despite this evidence, the active mechanisms for these effects are not known. It is 
possible that the stress-reducing benefits are driven by the training of specific psychological 
skills taught in mindfulness interventions. If this were the case, removing the training of 
these critical skills from mindfulness interventions would either attenuate or altogether 
eliminate stress reduction benefits. Here we report the results of a randomized controlled 
dismantling trial explicitly testing active psychological mechanisms of mindfulness 
interventions for reducing stress, measured using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) 
in daily life. Participants were randomly assigned to complete either: (i) a full 8-week 
MBSR training program that taught the standard combination of monitoring and acceptance 
skills; or (ii) a modified but structurally equivalent MBSR intervention that removed 
acceptance skills training and taught attention monitoring skills only.
Mindfulness is commonly described as the act of purposefully attending to the present 
moment experience with an attitude of acceptance and equanimity ( Kabat-Zinn, 2009 ). Most 
mindfulness definitions used in contemporary empirical research contexts include two 
components: (i) intentionally guided attention to monitor present moment experiences; and 
(ii) adopting an attitude of acceptance toward these experiences. Monitor and Acceptance 
Theory (MAT) is one recent mechanistic account of mindfulness training which posits that 
both attention monitoring and acceptance skills play important roles in improving a broad 
range of outcomes in mindfulness training interventions ( Lindsay & Creswell, 2017 ). 
Specifically, this account suggests that acceptance is an emotion regulation skill that fosters 
non-reactivity and openness to present moment experiences, and that the removal of 
acceptance skills training may eliminate the stress-buffering benefits of mindfulness 
interventions. Based on experimental evidence from an initial smartphone-based dismantling 
trial showing that acceptance skills training is necessary for reducing reactivity to a 
laboratory stress challenge ( Lindsay, Young, Smyth, Brown, & Creswell, 2018 ), it was 
hypothesized that removing acceptance skills training from a mindfulness intervention 
would attenuate or eliminate reductions in stress during daily life measured using EMA.Chin et al. Page 2

EMA is particularly well-suited to study dynamic processes such as stress in daily life 
(Smyth & Stone, 2003 ) and provides several advantages compared to traditional recall-based 
measures. Compared to such measures, EMA is thought to minimize recall bias and 
maximize ecological validity ( Shiffman, Stone, & Hufford, 2008 ). EMA measures have, at 
least in some contexts, also been shown to be more predictive of future outcomes than recall-
based questionnaire measures (e.g., Kamarck, Muldoon, Shiffman, & Sutton-Tyrrell, 2007 ). 
EMA measures may also be more sensitive to training-related changes. For example, one 
study found that EMA measures provided greater sensitivity than questionnaire measures to 
detect changes in depression and anxiety symptoms following an 8-week MBSR 
intervention ( Moore, Depp, Wetherell, & Lenze, 2016 ).
The primary aim of this RCT was to test theory-guided predictions about whether the 
removal of acceptance skills training attenuates or eliminates the stress-buffering benefits of 
an 8-week MBSR intervention ( Lindsay & Creswell, 2017 ). This study experimentally 
manipulated whether participants learned both monitoring and acceptance skills or 
monitoring skills only, with the aim of testing whether removing acceptance skills training 
attenuated the stress buffering benefits of mindfulness interventions. To do this, stressed 
community adults were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (i) Monitor & Accept 
(MA) training; (ii) Monitor Only (MO) training; or (iii) a no treatment (NT) control 
condition. Stress was assessed five times daily on three consecutive days at both baseline 
and post-intervention using EMA. The primary pre-registered hypothesis for this study was 
that 8-week MA training would reduce psychological stress during daily life compared to 
both MO training and NT control. To test this, participants (i) rated their momentary level of 
stress at each assessment and (ii) indicated whether or not they had experienced any feelings 
of stress since completing the previous assessment. Finally, the MAT account posits that 
acceptance skills training can increase non-judgment toward one’s momentary experiences. 
As a manipulation check for the experimental dismantling approach used in this study, 
participants provided momentary ratings of the degree to which they had been judging the 
self, thoughts and feelings, momentary experiences, and other people. It was predicted, as a 
secondary hypothesis, that MA training would increase daily life non-judgmental 
perceptions compared to MO training and NT control.
Methods
Participants.
Participants were 137 stressed community adults between the ages of 18–67 ( M=37 years1, 
SD=13.4). The sample was 67.2% female, 66.4% white, 15.3% African-American, 10.2% 
Asian, and 8.0% other ethnicities. Recruitment was conducted via participant registries, 
community advertisements, and mass emails to local organizations for a study testing 8-
week training programs for stress reduction and well-being. Eligible participants were fluent 
English-speaking smartphone owners (Android or iPhone) between the age of 18–70 years 
in good mental and physical health, who scored >5 on the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale2 (S. 
Cohen & Williamson, 1988 ; Sheldon Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983 ). Participant

exclusion criteria included: chronic mental or physical disease; hospitalization in the past 3 
months; medication use that interferes with HPA axis or immune system functioning; current 
oral contraceptive use; current pregnancy; current antibiotic, antiviral, or antimicrobial 
treatment; recreational drug use or excessive alcohol or tobacco use; and travel to countries 
on the CDC travel alert list in the past 6 months. Finally, individuals with significant 
experience with or daily practice of mindfulness meditation or related mind-body practices 
(defined as >2 times per week or >90 minutes of weekly practice) were also excluded. All 
participants provided written informed consent and all study procedures were approved by 
the Carnegie Mellon University IRB. Study data were collected at Carnegie Mellon 
University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania between August 2015 and November 2016. 
Recruitment was halted once the target sample size had been reached.
G*Power was used to calculate an a priori  target sample size needed to test primary study 
aims. These calculations were based upon previous 8-week mindfulness intervention studies 
typically demonstrating medium-large effect sizes (~ η2=.06-.18) for both daily stress and 
stress-reactivity outcomes relative to no treatment (e.g., Creswell, Pacilio, Lindsay, & 
Brown, 2014 ). Using a two-tailed Type I error rate of .05, a desired power of .90, an 
estimated ICC for time of .6, and a design of 3 groups measured at 2 time points, the 
required calculated sample size for an omnibus test of primary study aims was 120.
Intervention Programs.— Participants were randomly assigned to one of three study 
conditions: (i) 8-week Monitor & Acceptance (MA) MBSR training program; (ii) 8-week 
Monitor Only (MO) adapted-MBSR training program; or (iii) No Treatment control group 
(NT). Briefly, MBSR is a standardized group-based program consisting of 8 weekly 2.5–3-
hour sessions, 1 day-long retreat during the sixth week, and approximately 45-minutes of 
daily home practice of meditation and informal mindfulness in daily life ( Kabat-Zinn, 1990 ). 
The MA program adhered to the standard MBSR curriculum although the length of the 
sessions was shortened to 2 hours. The MO program, which also included 2 hour sessions, 
adapted MBSR by emphasizing the concentration/observing aspects of MBSR and removing 
acceptance/non-judgment language and practices. The MA and MO programs were taught in 
counterbalanced order by a certified MBSR instructor and a qualified MBSR instructor, both 
of whom had completed teacher trainings through the UMass Center for Mindfulness. The 
MO program was adapted from standard MBSR curriculum by c-authors in consultation 
with a former senior teacher at the UMass Center for Mindfulness (see ,Author 
Contributions and Acknowledgements) along with supporting mindfulness training sources 
(e.g., Foust, 2014 ; Goenka, 1994 ; Trungpa, 2003 ). The NT control group received minimal 
contact from study personnel during the intervention period, and completed all other study 
activities and assessments.
Monitor & Accept (MA; Standard MBSR program).— During each group session, an 
MBSR instructor leads guided mindfulness meditations intended to help foster the ability to 
come into direct contact with, and monitor one’s current body sensations, mental images, 
2The 4-item PSS is a validated measure and this short form was used to minimize participant burden during the phone screening. 
PSS-4 scores at baseline in this study ( M=8.22, SD=1.85, n=132) were appreciably higher than previously reported population means 
for this scale ( M=4.49, SD=2.96 by Cohen & Williamson, 1988; M=6.11, SD=3.14 by Warttig, Forshaw, South, & White (2013) .Chin et al. Page 4

emotions, and thoughts with an accepting, allowing attitude. As the sessions proceed, 
participants are invited to acknowledge their habitual reactions to stressful situations, 
eventually discovering that mindful awareness allows for additional choices in response to 
stress. Acceptance, or a non-judgmental, matter-of-fact attitude, is encouraged in the MA 
condition only. All class sessions and home practice audios include instructions for focusing 
and returning attention using language that encourages a gentle and accepting attitude 
towards sensory experiences and the fact that human minds wander. This attitudinal quality 
was also reinforced during instructor-led class discussions. Monitoring, or focusing and 
returning attention, is also included in the MA training program because developing this 
skill is an important early building block for learning to meditate. During class activities, 
MA participants are encouraged to “invite in” experiences with curiosity and interest, and to 
adopt a non-judgmental and accepting attitude towards their monitored experiences 
regardless of whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. Participants attend a seven-hour 
retreat during the sixth week of MBSR that is focused on integrating and elaborating upon 
the mindfulness skills learned throughout the course. Finally, participants are asked to 
complete approximately 40–45-minutes of daily home practice six days per week during the 
eight-week course (4.0–4.5 hours of practice per week). Daily home practice consists of 
recordings from the classroom instructor guiding participants through meditations such as 
body scanning, mindful movement, and sitting meditation, as well as informal mindfulness 
practice during daily life.
Monitor Only (MO; Adapted MBSR).— Monitoring, or training to sense into and 
observe one’s experience, is explicitly taught in standard MBSR and in the MO condition of 
this project. Participants are taught to focus their attention on an aspect of their present 
moment experience, such as sensations of breathing or other body sensations. They are 
asked to notice when their attention wanders and return it to the direct perception of the 
focal sensory object, and to monitor their present moment experiences during guided 
activities. The MO adaptations of the MBSR program primarily consisted of 1) changes in 
language, and 2) emphasizing concentration practices, specifically regarding body 
awareness. Changes in language included avoiding use of the words: accept, acceptance, 
allow, being with, letting go of judgment, non-judgment,  and instead referring to: direct 
perception, observe, monitor, return to the anchor (e.g., of breath sensation ). Thus, 
acceptance language was not included in the MO class instruction or home practice audios, 
and was also avoided by the instructor as much as possible during group discussions. The 
MO program emphasized concentration and attention monitoring. One such practice 
consisted of anchoring attention to breath or other body sensation or sound in order to return 
to present moment experience. The MO program did not include some meditative practices 
that are typically included in standard MBSR, such as open awareness meditation without a 
focal object. Like MA, MO participants completed a retreat day and the same amount of 
guided home practice. As a conservative test of study hypotheses, it is important to note that 
although the language and practices associated with acceptance were excised as much as 
was possible from MO, the teachers still embodied the acceptance and inclusion that are 
considered essential to cultivating a safe and effective learning environment for participants 
in the MBSR program. Moreover, focusing and returning attention can result in a greater 
sense of clarity and reduced distraction and distress, so it is also possible that some Chin et al. Page 5

participants developed a more accepting attitude over time on their own as they continued to 
practice MO meditation.
Measures.
Stress and non-judgmental perceptions were assessed via signal-prompted assessment five 
times daily for three days at baseline and three days post-intervention. To assess stress, 
participants were asked to indicate how much stress they were experiencing or feeling right 
now on a seven-point Likert scale with anchors at 1 (mild),  4 (moderate),  and 7 (severe).  To 
assess occasions stressed, participants were also asked to provide a yes/no response to 
indicate whether they had experienced stress in the time since they completed the previous 
assessment. Items assessing stress and occasions stressed were adapted from previously 
published studies (e.g., Neubauer, Smyth, & Sliwinski, 2018 ; Smyth & Heron, 2016 ). To 
assess perceptions of non-judgment, participants were asked to indicate the degree to which 
they agreed that they had been judging as good or bad each of four domains since the 
previous assessment: (i) themselves; (ii) their thoughts and feelings; (iii) situations they were 
in or events that occurred; and (iv) other people they interacted with or thought about, on a 
six-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree)  to 6 (strongly agree).  Items assessing perceptions 
of non-judgment were adapted from existing trait mindfulness and acceptance scales (e.g., 
Baer, Smith, & Allen, 2004 ; Baer, Smith, Hopkins, Krietemeyer, & Toney, 2006 ). These 
items were intended to measure nonjudgment as conceptualized in the mindfulness 
literature. Responses to all four items were reverse scored such that higher values indicated 
greater non-judgment and were averaged to create a single value representing overall non-
judgment ( α=.883).
Participants assigned to either the MA or MO MBSR conditions ( n=107) completed the 6-
item Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ; Devilly & Borkovec, 2000 ) which asked 
participants to rate the degree to which they believed the MBSR classes would be beneficial. 
This measure was included to ensure that any differences in how MA and MO training 
affected stress and non-judgmental perceptions were not due to differences in positive 
treatment expectancies (i.e., placebo effects). Responses across all six items were averaged 
to create a single value representing treatment expectancies ( α=.912).
Procedures.
This study was a three-arm randomized controlled trial preregistered with Clinical Trials 
identifier NCT02502227 . This manuscript reports pre-registered primary (daily life stress 
assessed using EMA), secondary (daily life state acceptance assessed using EMA), and other 
(treatment expectancies) outcome measures from this trial. All outcome measures reported 
here remained unanalyzed until data collection was complete.
Interested participants were screened for eligibility both via telephone and at an in-person 
baseline appointment by trained research assistants and staff. During this baseline 
appointment, eligible participants provided a dried blood spot (DBS) sample, completed a 
questionnaire and task battery, and were oriented to the study’s schedule and activities.

Participants then completed three consecutive days of pre-intervention EMA and daily diary 
assessments. Next, participants were randomized into one of three study conditions using a 
random number generator in a 3–3-2 randomization sequence generated by a study 
statistician who was not involved with participant enrollment (for every 8 participants 
randomized, 3 were assigned to Monitor & Accept, 3 to Monitor Only, 2 to No Treatment). 
To maintain allocation concealment, only essential study personnel (e.g., the MBSR 
instructors) had knowledge of participant allocation and all assessors were blind to condition 
assignment. Following the 8-week intervention period, participants completed three 
consecutive days of post-intervention EMA and diary assessments before returning to the 
laboratory for a post-intervention appointment. At this appointment, condition-blind 
research staff directed participants as they provided a DBS sample and completed a 
questionnaire and task battery. Finally, all participants were debriefed, informed of the 
study’s primary aims, and compensated for their participation.
Ecological Momentary Assessment.— EMA surveys were administered using 
participants’ personal smartphones using Qualtrics surveys delivered through SurveySignal 
text links and MetricWire surveys. Participants were prompted to complete five EMA 
surveys daily at quasi-random times each day (30 surveys total across the baseline and post-
intervention periods). Text links were sent during each of five 2-hour blocks distributed 
between 9:00 am and 7:00 pm, with links expiring after 45 minutes. Although not reported 
here, participants were also prompted to complete daily diary assessments at 8:30 pm each 
day (6 daily diary assessments total across the baseline and post-intervention periods); links 
were sent at exactly 8:30 pm and remained active until 11:30 pm. Participants were trained 
to complete all EMA assessments during the baseline study appointment. To encourage 
adherence, participants received $60 base compensation plus an additional maximum of $40 
for compliance with the EMA protocols. At both baseline and post-intervention, EMA 
assessments began on a Wednesday and concluded on a Friday.
Data Analysis.
Mixed models were used as a primary data analytic approach, given that they model all 
available data and follow intention-to-treat principles4. Specifically, 3-level multilevel 
models nesting EMA observations (Level-1) within days (Level-2) within individuals 
(Level-3) were used to test for Time x Condition differences using the mixed  command in 
Stata software (Version 15.1, StataCorp, College Station, Texas). For the dichotomous 
outcome (occasions stressed), identical 3-level models were tested using Stata’s melogit 
command. All multilevel mixed effect linear regressions used restricted maximum likelihood 
estimation with an identity covariance matrix. The multilevel logistic regression used an 
unstructured random-effects covariance matrix. Time, condition, the time × condition 
interaction, and observation number within day were modeled as fixed effects. Random 
intercepts were included in the model for both participant and day of assessment. The use of 
multilevel models in this analytic approach is considered optimal because they provide 
relatively unbiased model estimates that account for missing data ( Allison, 2012 ).
4There were no appreciable changes to any result in secondary analyses which examined only participants who completed the 
intervention ( n=98).Chin et al. Page 7

Although multilevel models in longitudinal studies typically include an autoregressive term 
(ρ) to account for serial autocorrelation between proximal observations, this could not be 
done here because the continuous term for time since study entry was collinear with the 
categorical predictor for time (baseline, post-intervention). Instead, 3-level models nesting 
observations within day of assessment (coded 0–2) were used to account for autocorrelation 
between consecutive measurements. To further account for potential autocorrelation, a fixed- 
effect term was included in the model for observation number within day (coded 0–4). 
Examining the residuals produced from these models indicated that these steps successfully 
detrended the data.
Results
Preliminary Analysis
Of the 137 randomized participants, 125 completed the post-intervention assessment, and 
125 completed at least one post-intervention EMA survey (see CONSORT flow chart in 
Figure 1). Of the 107 individuals assigned to one of the 8-week MBSR classes, 98 
completed the intervention (91.6%). Success of randomization on major demographic 
characteristics in the full randomized sample ( N=137) was evaluated. There were no 
baseline differences across conditions in age, sex, race, or education (see Table 1). There 
were also no condition differences in compliance with EMA protocols at baseline. Among 
the 125 participants who completed post-intervention EMA, there were also no condition 
differences in adherence to the EMA protocol at post-intervention. Overall, participants 
completed 69.2% of all possible EMA surveys across baseline and post-intervention.
Next, condition differences in treatment expectancies at Week 1, Week 4, and Week 8 of the 
intervention were tested using all available data from individuals assigned to one of the two 
study interventions ( n=107). There were no differences between the two training conditions 
in positive treatment expectancies at any time (all ps>.53). Finally, condition differences in 
treatment adherence were tested among the 98 individuals who completed their assigned 
intervention. There were no differences between the two training conditions in the number 
of classes attended. There was also no difference between the two training conditions in 
number of minutes of home practice5 (F(1,96)=2.97, p=.088) or number of home practice 
sessions ( F(1,96)=1.72, p=.193). On average, MA participants completed 13.57 hours of 
home practice ( SD=7.97; range: 0–29.94) across 27.1 sessions ( SD=10.9, range: 0–42) 
whereas MO participants completed 10.72 hours of practice ( SD=8.41; range: 0.02–26.31 
hours) across 24.2 sessions (SD=10.5, range: 2–41) during the eight week intervention. 
However, adding minutes of home practice as a person-level covariate (with a value of zero 
for NT participants) to all primary analyses did not appreciably change any of the reported 
results. Moreover, minutes of home practice were not associated with baseline to post-
intervention changes in momentary stress (MA: b=−.099, SE<001, p=.501; MO: b=−.057, 
SE<001, p=.712) or non-judgment (MA: b=.006, SE<001, p=.970; MO: b=.086, SE<.001, 
5While home practice audios were 40–45 minutes in duration, participants would occasionally receive credit for additional practice 
time due to issues with the software platform. To correct these outliers, any home practice session greater than 45 minutes in duration 
were recoded to 45 minutes.Chin et al. Page 8

p=.577). Finally, there were also no baseline differences across conditions for any study 
outcome reported below (all ps>.20) indicating successful randomization.
Condition differences in change in non-judgment over time were examined as a 
manipulation check for the experimental dismantling approach used in this study. It was 
hypothesized that MA training would increase non-judgment relative to both MO training 
and NT control. To test this hypothesis, 3-level MLMs were used to evaluate the 
hypothesized time by condition interaction. There was no main effect of condition 
(χ2(2)=4.90, p=.0865) but there was a main effect of time ( χ2(1)=255.50, p<.0001). 
Consistent with predictions, this was qualified by an interaction between time and condition 
(χ2(2)=30.82, p<.0001). Participants across all conditions showed an increase in daily life 
non-judgmental perceptions from baseline to post-intervention (MA: 3.83(12) to 4.58(.12), 
d=88; MO: 3.64(.12) to 4.25(.12), d=73; NT: 3.65(.17) to 3.92(.16), d=.31); however as 
predicted, this increase was significantly greater for MA participants compared to both MO 
(χ2(1)=4.40, p=.0360, d=.16) and NT participants ( χ2(1)=30.82, p<.0001, d=. 56). This 
increase was also significantly greater for MO participants compared to NT participants 
(χ2(1)=14.25, p=.0002, d=.39).
EMA Stress
Stress Ratings.— It was hypothesized that MA participants would have greater reductions 
in momentary stress than MO or NT participants. To test this hypothesis, 3-level MLMs 
were used to evaluate the hypothesized time by condition interaction. There were main 
effects of condition ( χ2(2)=6.72, p=.0347) and time ( χ2(1)=128.12, p<.0001). Consistent 
with predictions, these effects were qualified by an interaction between time and condition 
(χ2(2)=9.89, p=.0071) (see Figure 2). Although participants across all conditions showed a 
decrease in stress ratings from baseline to post-intervention (MA mean change = .85, p<.
0001, d=.85; MO mean change = .58, p<.0001, d=.59; NT mean change = .45, p<.0001, d=.
44), this decrease was significantly greater for MA participants compared to both MO 
(χ2(1)=5.57, p=.0183, d=.27) and NT participants ( χ2(1)=7.91, p=.0049, d=.40). There was 
no difference in stress reduction over time between MO and NT participants ( χ2(1)=0.79, 
p=.3741, d=.13). (See Table 2 for condition means).
Occasions Stressed.— It was also hypothesized that MA participants would have greater 
reductions in the proportion of assessments in which they reported experiencing any feelings 
of stress compared to MO or NT participants. To test this hypothesis, we used 3-level MLMs 
to evaluate the time by condition interaction. Across all 2721 assessment responses, this high 
stress participant sample reported feeling stressed on 1565 occasions (57.52%). There was 
no main effect of condition ( χ2(2)=5.50, p=.0641), but there was a main effect of time 
(χ2(1)=34.17, p<.0001). Consistent with prediction, these effects were qualified by an 
interaction between time and condition ( χ2(2)=13.34, p=.0013). Although participants 
across all conditions showed a decrease from baseline to post-intervention in the proportion 
of assessments that they reported experiencing any feelings of stress (MA participants: .66 
to .45, d=.73; MO participants: .62 to .52, d=.36; NT participants: .72 to .68, d=.16), this 
decrease was significantly greater for MA participants compared to both MO ( χ2(1)=8.53, 
p=.0035, d=.38) and NT participants ( χ2(1)=9.85, p=.0017, d=.62). There was no difference Chin et al. Page 9

in change in occasions stressed between MO and NT participants ( χ2(1)=0.93, p=.3356, d=.
22).
When participants reported experiencing stress since the last assessment, they were 
prompted to answer three additional exploratory questions. These items assessed how much 
of the time participants were feeling stressed, how severe their feelings of stress were, and 
how successful they believed they were in coping with stress. As these items were only 
sampled in a subset of measurement occasions (57.5% of total measurement occasions) and 
because there were condition differences in the number of times participants indicated stress

Discussion
This dismantling RCT provides one of the first experimental tests of the mechanisms linking 
mindfulness interventions with reduced stress. Consistent with hypotheses, MA participants 
had greater reductions in both stress ratings and occasions stressed compared to both MO 
and NT participants. These findings add to a growing body of research examining the stress- 
reducing benefits of mindfulness interventions by providing evidence that these benefits may 
be driven by acceptance skills training.
This study experimentally demonstrates the important role of acceptance skills training in 
mindfulness interventions and also provides data consistent with the notion that increases in 
non-judgment may drive stress-reduction benefits. Specifically, MA participants had greater 
increases in non-judgmental perceptions during daily life at post-intervention compared to 
both MO and NT participants. This study provides the first evidence that increased non-
judgment towards experiences in daily life may be one mechanism through which 
mindfulness training interventions reduce stress. One interesting implication of these 
findings is that training individuals to adopt an accepting attitude toward present moment 
experience reduces the tendency to construct evaluative and judgment-laden narratives about 
these experiences. Consistent with this notion, this type of evaluative attention has been 
shown to be associated with negative psychological outcomes such as depression and 
anxiety ( Mor & Winquist, 2002 ). Moreover, our present measure of non-judgment was 
focused on measuring a more general orientation of non-judgment towards aspects of daily 
life including perceptions of the self, others, one’s thoughts and feelings, and everyday 
situations, suggesting that training acceptance skills in relation to momentary experiences 
may also help foster a broader non-evaluative lens toward one’s self and one’s current 
situation.
Monitor and Acceptance Theory (MAT) is one mechanistic account of mindfulness training 
which predicts that removing acceptance skills training from mindfulness interventions will 
attenuate both their stress reduction benefits and their protective effects against a host of 
stress-related diseases ( Lindsay & Creswell, 2017 ). This RCT extends initial work 
demonstrating that acceptance training is necessary to reduce biological stress reactivity in 
the laboratory ( Lindsay et al., 2018 ) by showing that acceptance skills training may also be Chin et al. Page 10

the critical mechanism for stress reduction benefits in daily life measured by EMA. One 
potentially surprising finding was that participants completing the 8-week MO training did 
not show declines in psychological stress relative to NT participants. However, this result is 
consistent with the prediction made by Monitor and Acceptance Theory (MAT; Lindsay & 
Creswell, 2017 ) that attention monitoring alone is not sufficient for reducing psychological 
stress.
It is possible that acceptance skills training provides a behavioral approach for improving 
how one copes with difficult or stressful experiences, fostering non-judgment and reducing 
primary threat appraisals and negative affective reactions to daily life stressors ( Slutsky, 
Rahl, Lindsay, & Creswell, 2016 ). The MA intervention class activities and home practice 
recordings invited participants to notice their thoughts, feelings, and sensations without 
attempting to suppress, avoid, or reject them. These instructions were intended to cultivate 
and support an attitude of acceptance and non-reactivity towards noticed experiences, even 
those that were unpleasant or uncomfortable. This attitude of acceptance was further 
reinforced during group discussions where class instructors modeled an attitude of non-
judgment as participants reflected upon their experiences during meditation practice and 
daily life. During the course of the 8-week intervention, participants learn that judging or 
trying to control the uncontrollable increases stress while acknowledgement or acceptance of 
the uncontrollable creates more ease and less stress. By reducing the habitual tendency to 
negatively judge and reject stressful events and experiences, developing acceptance skills 
may allow individuals to respond to such situations in a less reactive and more deliberate 
and adaptive manner.
The health psychology literature has long focused on how stress can increase risk for a broad 
range of negative psychological (e.g., depression) and physical health (e.g., cardiovascular 
disease) outcomes ( Cohen, Janicki-Deverts, & Miller, 2007 ). This study contributes to a 
growing stress management intervention literature showing how specific elements of 
interventions (i.e., acceptance skills training) may be key mechanisms for promoting stress 
resilience (cf. Antoni et al., 2006 ). One potential implication of this work which should be 
tested in future studies is that the stress reduction benefits of acceptance skills training 
observed here may foster better stress- related psychological and physical health outcomes 
over time. Indeed, acceptance skills training may be a key health protective factor for 
stressed and at risk patient populations, and may help explain the stress-related health 
benefits of mindfulness interventions among a wide range of patient groups (e.g., HIV , 
depression, addictive disorders) ( Creswell, 2017 ; Creswell, Villalba, Lindsay, & Chin, in 
press).
These findings are consistent with correlational work suggesting that high levels of 
selfreported experiential acceptance are associated with lower psychological distress and 
improved psychological health ( Ford, Lam, John, & Mauss, 2017 ). One important 
consideration, which is not explored here, is that acceptance skills can be trained in other 
types of behavioral interventions besides mindfulness meditation training. For example, 
there are other interventions centered around the development of acceptance skills such as 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes, 2004 ). Future work is also needed to Chin et al. Page 11

test methods for training acceptance skills alone and the impact of these intervention 
approaches on psychological stress.
There are several potential limitations to the current study. One is that monitoring and 
acceptance skills were not manipulated in a full 2 × 2 factorial design that included an 
acceptance only training condition. Although this possibility was considered, it was 
ultimately determined that training in attention monitoring is a necessary skill for learning 
how to accept monitored experiences within the context of a mindfulness intervention. 
Specifically, using one’s attention to monitor present experiences is a critical prerequisite to 
implementing any type of behavioral skills training, and it is difficult to conceive of a 
mindfulness-based acceptance skills training program that does not require participants to 
use their attention. Second, another limitation of this study was that the concurrent 
measurement of non-judgmental perceptions and momentary stress did not provide the 
temporal precedence necessary to conduct mediation analyses. Future work is necessary to 
more carefully test the causal role of non-judgment as a mediating mechanism for 
mindfulness training effects. Moreover, it is also possible that the MA and MO training 
programs differed on additional components besides the training of acceptance skills despite 
the dismantling approach used to construct these interventions. Third, an additional 
limitation of this study is that the learning of acceptance skills was not directly measured. 
One important direction for future research is to develop new measures which assess the 
learning of acceptance skills. Fourth, while one significant strength of this study is that it 
compares two well-matched active mindfulness interventions which were equivalent in 
terms of increasing positive treatment expectancies, it is important to acknowledge that the 
third arm was an inactive no treatment group. Although the use of a non-active control group 
suggests that improvements in stress among MA participants were not simply due to an 
effect of time, this feature of the study does not permit inferences about the stress buffering 
benefits of mindfulness interventions compared to other stress management programs. 
However, initial research suggests that mindfulness interventions have benefits above and 
beyond some other stress management interventions ( Creswell et al., 2016 ; Lindsay et al., 
2018 ). Next, the EMA items used to assess stress and non-judgment in this study were 
adapted from previously validated measures, but like most in the field have not been 
extensively tested or validated. Finally, because this study examined a sample that was 
predominantly white, female, and highly educated, it is important to test the degree to which 
these results are generalizable to other populations.
These findings raise broader questions about the implications of MA effects for stress- 
related health outcomes. Previous work has linked stress, assessed using EMA, with 
outcomes such as positive affect, negative affect, and health behaviors (e.g., Smyth et al., 
2009 ), suggesting that including acceptance skills training in mindfulness interventions may 
potentially confer similar benefits in these populations. Indeed, previous RCTs of 
mindfulness interventions provide promising initial evidence for a broad range of stress-
related health benefits, such as reducing depression relapse among at risk individuals 
(Kuyken et al., 2016 ), reducing experimentally-induced inflammation ( Rosenkranz et al., 
2013 ), and decreasing symptom severity among patients with irritable bowel syndrome 
(Garland et al., 2012 ). Although the effect sizes for analyses comparing changes among MA 
and MO participants over time are relatively small, it is important to acknowledge that these Chin et al. Page 12

interventions were structurally equivalent 8-week training programs that produced 
equivalent positive treatment expectancies. By comparing the stress-reduction effects of two 
well-matched interventions, this dismantling study contributes to a new wave of 
mechanistically-focused mindfulness RCTs which allow investigators to evaluate the 
contributions of specific intervention components (e.g., Britton et al., 2018).
Conclusions
This theoretically-driven dismantling RCT tested the mechanisms of mindfulness training 
for stress-reduction. Consistent with predictions, participants trained to both monitor and 
accept present moment experiences showed greater reductions in daily life stress compared 
to participants trained in monitoring skills only. A notable strength of this study is the use of 
a highly ecologically valid EMA measurement strategy to assess changes in state stress. 
These findings provide evidence that acceptance skills training is an important and perhaps 
understudied mechanism of mindfulness interventions ( Lindsay & Creswell, 2017 ). 
Furthermore, this RCT work highlights the value of conducting dismantling studies of 
mindfulness interventions to evaluate mechanistic pathways linking behavioral interventions 
with stress and health.
