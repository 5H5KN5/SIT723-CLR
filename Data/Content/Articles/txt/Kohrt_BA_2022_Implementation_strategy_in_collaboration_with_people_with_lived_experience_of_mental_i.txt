Abstract 
Background: There are increasing efforts for the integration of mental health services into primary care settings in 
low- and middle-income countries. However, commonly used approaches to train primary care providers (PCPs) may 
not achieve the expected outcomes for improved service delivery, as evidenced by low detection rates of mental 
illnesses after training. One contributor to this shortcoming is the stigma among PCPs. Implementation strategies for 
training PCPs that reduce stigma have the potential to improve the quality of services.
Design: In Nepal, a type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness cluster randomized controlled trial will evaluate the 
implementation-as-usual training for PCPs compared to an alternative implementation strategy to train PCPs, entitled 
Reducing Stigma among Healthcare Providers (RESHAPE). In implementation-as-usual, PCPs are trained on the World 
Health Organization Mental Health Gap Action Program Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) with trainings conducted by 
mental health specialists. In RESHAPE, mhGAP-IG training includes the added component of facilitation by people 
with lived experience of mental illness (PWLE) and their caregivers using PhotoVoice, as well as aspirational figures. 
The duration of PCP training is the same in both arms. Co-primary outcomes of the study are stigma among PCPs, as 
measured with the Social Distance Scale at 6 months post-training, and reach, a domain from the RE-AIM implemen-
tation science framework. Reach is operationalized as the accuracy of detection of mental illness in primary care facili-
ties and will be determined by psychiatrists at 3 months after PCPs diagnose the patients. Stigma will be evaluated as

Contributions to the literature
• Stigma related to mental illness among primary care 
providers is a barrier to accurate detection of patients 
with mental illnesses because providers who stigmatize 
do not ask about mental illness, do not conduct thor -
ough assessments, and do not develop diagnostic com -
petency.
• Based on the evidence for social contact interventions, 
a collaboration of people with lived experience of men -
tal illness, who participate as co-facilitators in trainings 
for primary care providers, has the potential to reduce 
stigma as well as improve the reach of services through 
accurate detection of mental illnesses.
• A type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness cluster 
randomized controlled trial in Nepal will evaluate the 
stigma and detection outcomes comparing implemen -
tation-as-usual training, which is based on the World 
Health Organization mental health Gap Action Pro -
gramme (mhGAP), vs. an alternative implementation 
strategy integrating people with lived experience of 
mental illness into mhGAP training.
Introduction
Background and rationale
There continues to be a major gap globally between the 
number of people living with mental illnesses and the 
number of people receiving minimally adequate treat -
ment. In the USA and other high-income countries, 
approximately 1 out of 5 persons receive minimally 
adequate care for depression [1]. In low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs), the number of people receiv -
ing minimally adequate care ranges from 1 out of 27 to 
1 out of 100 for conditions including depression, anxiety, 
and substance use disorders [1–3] and 1 out of 6 for psy -
chosis [4]. To address this gap in LMICs, a key strategy 
has been training primary care providers (PCPs) in the diagnosis and treatment of people with mental illnesses. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) developed the 
mental health Gap Action Programme Intervention 
Guide (mhGAP-IG) to train PCPs to detect people with 
mental illnesses and deliver evidence-supported inter -
ventions [5].
However, research to date suggests that implemen -
tation strategies for mhGAP-IG and similar initiatives 
are not yielding the optimal benefit of these primary 
care-based strategies. In a recent meta-analysis cover -
ing 12 LMICs, the pooled depression detection rate in 
primary care was 7% [6]. In Kenya, only 5% of primary 
care facilities detected one or more people with mental 
illnesses 3 months after training [7]. In Ethiopia, only 
1.3% of patients with depression were accurately detected 
by mhGAP-trained primary care workers [8]. In Malawi, 
only 1 out of 10 patients with depression and 1 out of 100 
patients with anxiety were correctly identified by trained 
PCPs [ 9]. In Nepal, fewer than half of patients with men -
tal illnesses were correctly identified by the mhGAP-
trained staff in primary care facilities, and for depression, 
only 1 out of 5 were correctly identified [10]. Similarly, in 
Nepal, psychosis was also accurately diagnosed among 
fewer than 1 out 10 patients [11].
Despite poor identification of mental illness, studies 
of primary care services in LMICs, including in Nepal, 
demonstrate that the correct treatments are provided 
if a patient is accurately diagnosed, and this leads to 
improved patient outcomes [10, 12, 13]. This suggests 
that the main bottleneck in expanding primary care ser -
vices is at the level of detection. The treatments are effec -
tive, but they are not adequately reaching the appropriate 
people, i.e., the right people are not given the right diag -
nosis to initiate the right treatment in a timely manner.
Stigma among PCPs against people with mental ill -
ness has been identified as a contributor to low detection 
rates in primary care-based mental health services [7–9, 
14–21]. This is because PCPs who stigmatize do not ask a mediator of reach. Cost-effectiveness and other RE-AIM outcomes will be assessed. Twenty-four municipalities, the 
unit of clustering, will be randomized to either mhGAP-IG implementation-as-usual or RESHAPE arms, with approxi-
mately 76 health facilities and 216 PCPs divided equally between arms. An estimated 1100 patients will be enrolled 
for the evaluation of accurate diagnosis of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis, or alcohol use disorder. 
Masking will include PCPs, patients, and psychiatrists.
Discussion: This study will advance the knowledge of stigma reduction for training PCPs in partnership with PWLE. 
This collaborative approach to training has the potential to improve diagnostic competencies. If successful, this 
implementation strategy could be scaled up throughout low-resource settings to reduce the global treatment gap for 
mental illness.

about mental illnesses, do not conduct thorough assess -
ments, and do not develop diagnostic competency [15, 
16, 22–25]. Therefore, one avenue to improve the accu -
rate detection of mental illnesses among patients in pri -
mary care is to integrate stigma reduction when training 
PCPs. In a review of more than 162 studies of mhGAP-IG 
trainings, only 15 had completed evaluations of stigma, of 
which 9 (60%) reported a reduction in stigma, and most 
of these had an extra explicit anti-stigma component 
added to standard mhGAP-IG curricula; none were ran -
domized controlled trials (RCTs) [13]. There is research 
from fields outside of mental health in which other stig -
matized conditions, such as HIV/AIDS, have shown an 
association between stigma reduction and improved clin -
ical detection and care [26–30].
Preliminary studies of the RESHAPE implementation 
strategy
To address this research gap in stigma reduction when 
training PCPs in mental healthcare, we designed an inter -
vention to support the engagement of people with lived 
experience of mental illness (PWLE) in the delivery of 
mhGAP-IG training [31]. This implementation strategy 
is entitled Reducing Stigma Among Healthcare Provid -
ers (RESHAPE). The conceptual foundation of RESHAPE 
is promoting empathy between PCPs and PWLE using 
intergroup contact theory from social psychology, as 
well as reduction of intergroup discrimination by lower -
ing threat and anxiety, as informed by social neurosci -
ence; this is framed as a “what matters most” approach to 
understand stigma using a moral framework from medi -
cal anthropology [32, 33].
The underlying tenet of RESHAPE is that when health 
workers feel low levels of threat (e.g., minimal risk to 
their own health and safety), feel professionally com -
petent to treat people with mental illnesses, and do not 
feel at risk of ostracization by coworkers and community 
members, there will be increased empathy and willing -
ness to initiate and follow-up care [34].
To implement RESHAPE, PWLE who are in different 
states of recovery and their caregivers are selected from 
the local community. They receive PhotoVoice training—
a participatory action research method [35] that has been 
used to address mental illness stigma [36]—to develop 
recovery testimonials that are delivered in-person with 
personalized photographs at mhGAP-IG trainings. In 
addition, the PWLE are trained in public speaking and to 
participate in question and answer (Q&A) sessions with 
PCPs.
Another component of RESHAPE is the use of aspi -
rational figures, who have previously been trained in 
mental healthcare and have shown high levels of motiva -
tion to treat patients with mental illness at their primary care facilities. The expectation is that PCPs in training 
will aspire to be like these colleagues who serve as role 
models. Aspirational figures are trained in myth-busting, 
which is a discussion of common myths and facts related 
to mental illness, and myth-busting has been identified as 
one of the active ingredients of effective stigma reduction 
[37]. Aspirational figures also present recovery stories of 
their patients. Full details on the RESHAPE strategy have 
been published previously [32].
Proof of concept testing of RESHAPE was conducted 
in Nepal [32], and a pilot cluster randomized controlled 
trial (cRCT) was conducted with 34 health facilities 
and 88 PCPs who had prescribing privileges in their 
health facilities [11]. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed 
with 69 patients. Mixed methods evaluation of the pilot 
cRCT demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the 
RESHAPE implementation strategy. Qualitative narra -
tives demonstrated that the PCPs felt they better under -
stood the experience of patients and felt more confident 
that they could diagnose and treat such patients after 
hearing the recovery narratives [32, 38–41]. They also 
had more willingness to initiate psychological services 
[41].
Quantitative analyses showed that PCPs in the 
RESHAPE arm had a 10.6 point reduction on the Social 
Distance Scale (SDS) [42] compared to only a 2.8 point 
reduction among PCPs in the implementation-as-usual 
(IAU) arm [11]. In addition, PCPs in the RESHAPE arm 
had 72.5% accuracy in patient diagnosis compared to 
34.5% accuracy among PCPs in the IAU arm [11]. In the 
IAU arm, depression was only accurately diagnosed in 
50% of patients, and psychosis was only accurate among 
7% of patients, whereas diagnoses were more accurate in 
the RESHAPE arm in the pilot. There were no adverse 
events in either arm.
All criteria for proceeding to a  full trial, as speci -
fied in the pilot, were met. Based on these pilot results, 
which were not powered for hypothesis testing, it was 
warranted to proceed to a full-scale trial that would be 
powered for hypothesis testing for stigma reduction and 
improved accuracy of detection.
Objectives
The cRCT has two co-primary objectives. Primary 
objective 1 is to determine the effect of the RESHAPE 
implementation strategy on stigma among PCPs (see 
Additional file  1: Fig. S1). This objective evaluates the 
attitudinal change among PCPs. Hypothesis: PCPs in the 
RESHAPE arm will have a greater reduction in stigma 
toward people with mental illness 6 months after train -
ing compared with primary care workers exposed to the 
standard training in IAU.
Page 4 of 16 Kohrt et al. Implementation Science           (2022) 17:39 
Primary objective 2 is to evaluate the effect of the 
RESHAPE implementation on reach. In the Reach 
Effectiveness-Adoption Implementation Maintenance 
(RE-AIM) framework [43– 45], “reach is the number, 
proportion of the intended audience, and the represent -
ativeness of participants compared with the intended 
audience” [46]. Reach will be operationalized as the 
accuracy of diagnosis among PCPs. Hypothesis: PCPs 
in the RESHAPE arm will have greater reach in terms 
of a greater proportion of patients accurately diagnosed 
compared to IAU.
Primary objective 2 is a type 3 implementation-effec -
tiveness objective because the implementation outcome 
(reach) is the primary focus. The effectiveness com -
ponent, which is secondary, addresses an intervention 
at the patient level that is the same in both arms (i.e., 
mhGAP-IG recommended pharmacological and psy -
chological treatments, see Table  1). It is only the imple -
mentation strategy with regard to how PCPs are trained 
which differs between the arms (implementing train -
ing-as-usual vs. RESHAPE). Therefore, one of the sec -
ondary objectives relates to the effectiveness of the care 
delivered. We hypothesize that RESHAPE will have 
non-inferior outcomes compared to IAU, i.e., a non-
inferiority hypothesis. We have selected a non-inferi -
ority approach because prior research in Nepal showed 
that, 6 months after training, PCPs delivered minimally 
adequate care for 94% of patients with depression and 
95% of patients with alcohol use disorder [10]. There -
fore, it is unlikely to improve upon this outcome when 
using RESHAPE, we thus want to test if the treatment outcomes are comparable across arms. This echoes 
the point raised above that detecting who needs care 
appears to be a bigger challenge than providing the 
right care once appropriate persons are identified.
Another secondary objective is to evaluate stigma 
reduction as a potential mediator of differences in reach 
(see Additional file  1: Fig. S1). By evaluating stigma as 
a mediator of reach, this can determine what degree of 
stigma change may be clinically relevant in terms of accu -
rately diagnosing patients. The contribution of stigma to 
reach can be evaluated in multi-mediation models that 
also take factors such as knowledge and competency 
into account. Evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the 
RESHAPE strategy is also a secondary objective. Addi -
tional file  1: Fig. S2 provides the full list of outcomes 
using the RE-AIM framework.
Methods
Trial design
The study design will be a parallel two-arm cRCT in 
Nepal randomizing 24 municipalities (i.e., clusters) in a 
1:1 ratio to one of two different implementation strate -
gies (see Fig.  1). The two arms are the Nepali government 
version of mhGAP taught by mental health specialists vs. 
the RESHAPE  arm, which is the Nepali mhGAP taught 
by specialists and PWLE, their caregivers, and aspira -
tional figures. Given the focus of this research on real-
world implementation, intention-to-treat is our primary 
framework.
A cluster design was selected because of the poten -
tial contamination of implementation strategies among Table 1 Intervention and implementation elements for implementation as usual (IAU) vs. RESHAPE

PCPs at the same facility, and the likelihood of shared 
patient management among PCPs. One change from 
the pilot cRCT to the current study was changing the 
level of clustering from the health facility (pilot design) 
to municipality (current full-scale design). This is 
because of the risk of government re-assignment of 
PCPs from one facility to another in the same munici -
pality. Also, because of high rates of turnover, there is 
a risk of losing entire clusters if all PCPs leave. There -
fore, by having multiple health facilities in a cluster, 
there was less risk of cluster loss.
Three to five health facilities per municipality will 
be enrolled: approximately 38 per arm, which equates 
to 76 facilities for the entire study. Approximately 1–3 
PCPs will be enrolled per health facility, with a tar -
get of 108 PCPs per arm. All health facilities within 
a municipality and all PCPs in those health facilities 
will be in the same arm, i.e., there is no mixing of arms 
within facilities or within municipalities. Across both 
arms, the goal will be to enroll approximately 1100 
total patients in the trial for diagnostic evaluations of 
depression, generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis, or 
alcohol use disorder. The study will report results for 
total accuracy and is powered for total patient accu -
racy. In addition, outcomes per mental health condi -
tion will be reported.Study setting
Nepal was selected as the site for this study because of 
our extensive preliminary research in this setting and 
because it exemplifies a low-resource context where the 
treatment gap for mental illness is high [47]. In a country 
of 29 million people, Nepal has approximately 200 psy -
chiatrists, i.e., 1.45 psychiatrists per 100,000 population 
[48], compared to 8 psychiatrists per 100,000 population 
in the USA. Nepal has high exposure to negative social 
determinants of health (war, environmental disasters, 
poverty, and gender-based and ethnic discrimination 
[49–66]), and the government is the main provider of 
healthcare throughout the country. Depression rates vary 
from 10 to 40% based on the setting [54, 60, 61, 67–71], 
with prevalence at primary care facilities of approxi -
mately 17% based on Nepali-validated Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scoring [64]. Suicide was recently 
the leading single cause of mortality among women of 
reproductive age [72]. In rural Nepal, 90% of female sui -
cides occur before 25 years of age [59]. Among patients 
attending primary care, 11% report suicidal ideation 
and 1.2% attempted  suicide in the past year [60]. There 
is also increasing political will to address mental health: 
the Nepal Ministry of Health and Population endorsed 
the National Mental Health Strategy and Action Plan in 
2021 [73]. Please see Additional file  1 for additional infor -
mation on the study setting and healthcare workforce in 
Nepal .

Interventions
In keeping with hybrid implementation-effectiveness tri -
als, an evidence-supported intervention is needed as the 
basis of which to evaluate different implementation strat -
egies; this will be the mhGAP-IG (www. who. int/ mental_ 
health/ mhgap) for our study [74, 75]. The mhGAP-IG is 
the standard for primary care-based mental health ser -
vices in LMIC and is being implemented in more than 
100 countries [74]. Materials for mhGAP have been 
translated and adapted for Nepal and evaluated through 
the Programme for Improving Mental health Care 
(PRIME) [76]. The mhGAP package, developed and vali -
dated with demonstrated evidence in Nepal, was a 9-day 
training on 4 mhGAP mental health conditions (depres -
sion, psychosis, alcohol use disorder, and epilepsy). The 
government has modified this to a 6-day training with 
10 mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, psy -
chosis, alcohol use disorder, epilepsy, conversion disor -
der, suicide, dementia, child and adolescent mental and 
behavioral disorders, and other significant mental health 
complaints). Of note, WHO mhGAP-IG does not include 
anxiety as a diagnosis. However, the Nepal government 
added generalized anxiety  disorder to their national 
mhGAP . There was no involvement of PWLE in the deci -
sion of the government to transition from the evidence-
based PRIME version of the mhGAP curriculum to the 
established government curriculum. This trial will use 
the government-approved curriculum. The conditions of 
interest for evaluation in this study, out of the 10 covered 
mental health conditions, will be depression, generalized 
anxiety disorder, psychosis, and alcohol use disorder.
Trainings are led by 1–2 Nepali psychiatrists who have 
previously participated in a training-of-trainers program 
to learn how to teach mhGAP-IG. An MPhil level psy -
chologist teaches the psychosocial components. For each 
mental health condition, the psychiatrist introduces the 
hallmark symptoms, discusses medication management 
and psychosocial interventions, and lists considerations 
for diagnosis and treatment with special populations, e.g., 
during pregnancy or when the person has a co-morbid 
medical condition. Pharmacological regimens for each 
mental health condition have been adapted according to 
what medications are freely available in Nepal.
In the RESHAPE implementation arm, the mhGAP-
IG training lasts the same duration (6 days) and covers 
the same content; however, the teaching style is different 
(see Fig.  2). For RESHAPE, instead of each mental health 
condition only being taught by a psychiatrist, there is also 
a PWLE and potentially his/her caregiver who will pre -
sent a recovery narrative about living with that particu -
lar mental health condition. PWLE and their caregivers 
also participate in brief Q&A sessions where PCPs can 
ask them about living with the condition, their treatment, and other topics of interest. There is typically one PWLE 
and potentially his/her caregiver taking part in each ses -
sion for the key mental health conditions, i.e., one PWLE 
of depression participating in the mhGAP-IG depres -
sion module section, a PWLE of generalized anxiety dis -
order, a PWLE of psychosis, and a PWLE of alcohol use 
disorder. Thus, there are approximately 4 PWLE shar -
ing recovery narratives during the training. In addition, 
videos may be used to supplement some modules, e.g., a 
video of a PWLE of depression [77].
In addition, the aspirational figures participate in two 
sessions. One session is on day 2 about myths and facts 
related to mental illness, and the other session is on day 
5 to discuss anticipated challenges and barriers when 
implementing mental health services in primary care. An 
aspirational figure may also accompany a PWLE, such as 
for the psychosis recovery narrative.
The RESHAPE implementation strategy is time-
matched with IAU training. For example, in IAU, the 
psychiatrist will spend 2 h describing the diagnosis and 
treatment of depression whereas in RESHAPE, the psy -
chiatrist would spend 90 min in didactic training fol -
lowed by a 30-min presentation by a PWLE and Q&A. 
This means that in RESHAPE, the PCPs in training 
receive less time with didactics exclusively taught by a 
psychiatrist.
In order to prepare PWLE and their caregivers for par -
ticipation in mhGAP-IG trainings, PWLE participate 
in approximately 8–12 sessions of PhotoVoice training 
[39] to develop their recovery narrative, practice pub -
lic speaking skills, and learn distress management skills 
in case of any emotional distress experienced while par -
ticipating in the training. The aspirational figures partici -
pate in approximately 4–5 sessions of training to practice 
myth-busting and to prepare narratives about their expe -
riences of delivering mental health services. Full details 
of PWLE, caregiver, and aspirational figure training are 
provided elsewhere [32].
Outcomes
PCP outcomes will include primary objective 1 and a 
number of secondary outcomes (Table  2 and Fig.  3). 
The primary outcome is the Social Distance Scale 
(SDS), which is a commonly used measure of stigma 
[42, 78, 79]. The SDS was developed in the 1920s by 
Bogardus [42] to measure the level of acceptability of 
various types of social relationships between Americans 
and members of common ethnic groups [78, 112]. The 
modified SDS has been widely used to measure men -
tal health-related stigma [78, 113]. The SDS measures 
the acceptability of different degrees of social distance 
and thus, by inference, the attitude of the respondent 
to the person with the condition [114]. A commonly 
Page 7 of 16
 Kohrt et al. Implementation Science           (2022) 17:39 
 
used version consists of questions that represent social 
contact with different degrees of distance, such as rent -
ing a room to someone with a condition under study, 
working in the same place, marrying one’s child to a 
person with the conditions, or engaging someone in 
child care. The SDS sum score represents the attitude 
of the respondent toward the condition. The SDS has 
been adapted for use both with and without vignettes, 
using a 6-point scale and 12 items. Cross-cultural use 
of SDS in LMIC across health conditions has recently 
been reviewed [115]. In this trial, PCPs will be pre -
sented with 3 versions of the SDS, in random order. 
Each version includes a vignette followed by 12 ques -
tions regarding willingness to engage with the person in the vignette. These 12 questions have been culturally 
adapted for Nepal and other LMICs [116]. The three 
vignettes represent persons with depression, psychosis, 
and alcohol use disorder. Of note, an SDS vignette for 
generalized anxiety disorder was not added in addition 
to depression, given that the current three vignettes 
cover common mental health conditions, severe men -
tal health conditions, and substance use conditions. 
Moreover, it would add to respondent burden in terms 
of additional questions and may lead to respondent 
inattention given the repetition of the same questions 
multiple times.
Secondary outcomes at the PCP level for objective 
1 include the Reported and Intended Behavior Scale

(RIBS), which is a measure of behavioral intentions 
[84]; PCP knowledge about mental health conditions 
and their treatment, as assessed with selected questions 
from the mhGAP knowledge test [85–87]; clinical skill 
as assessed with a structured role play that is rated with 
the Enhancing Assessment of Common Therapeutic fac -
tors (ENACT) [88, 89], an observational tool with  15 
competencies linked to “common factors” for good qual -
ity psychosocial care; and a supplementary competency 
assessment for 5 mhGAP competencies. In addition, after 
each structured role play, PCPs are asked about what 
diagnosis and treatment they would recommend for the 
standardized patient. In addition to explicit stigma, we 
will measure implicit stigma with the Implicit Associa -
tion Test (IAT) adapted for Nepal [11]. A self-report of 
clinical self-efficacy is also collected [85–87].
The patient-level data will be evaluated in objective 2, 
which includes the implementation-effectiveness com -
ponent. The primary implementation outcome is reach, 
operationalized as the accuracy of diagnosis. This will 
be established by recruiting patients from primary care 
facilities during months 4–6 post-training. The patients 
visiting the health facility will be evaluated by PCPs. 
After PCP evaluation, a researcher stationed in each 
health facility will screen the consenting patients with 
locally validated tools for PHQ-9 [67] for depression, 
the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) for anxiety, 
a version of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
(PANSS) [94] previously adapted for self or caregiver 
report in Nepal (the Nepali version includes screening items before proceeding to the 14 items), and the Alcohol 
Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) [104].
If the person is identified by the PCP as having a mental 
health condition, the patient will be recruited for follow-
up at the 3-month period. Similarly, a subset of patients 
visiting health facilities who are not detected as hav -
ing mental health conditions by PCPs will be randomly 
selected and asked to participate as well. This will include 
a selection of both patients who score above and below 
screening cutoffs, with over recruitment of those screen -
ing above cutoffs, as they are more likely to have a missed 
diagnosis.
At 3 months after patient enrollment, a psychiatrist will 
complete a remote structured clinical interview using the 
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5-Research Ver -
sion (SCID-5-RV) [91], including the modules for depres -
sion, generalized anxiety, mania, schizophrenia, and 
alcohol use disorder. The 3-month period between PCP 
diagnosis and psychiatrist SCID evaluation is because 
PCPs may do an initial assessment and then ask a patient 
to return in a few weeks to confirm the diagnosis. There -
fore, PCPs have a 3-month window to confirm or revise 
their clinical diagnoses. The last recorded clinical diag -
nosis of the 3-month period will be the one compared 
against the psychiatrist’s SCID outcome.
In the SCID, each mental health condition includes 
screening questions, and if screening questions are posi -
tive, the psychiatrist proceeds to a full battery for that 
module to make diagnoses according to the DSM-5 
criteria. Of note, co-morbidities can be identified if

participants meet the criteria for multiple disorders. 
From a feasibility perspective, it is not possible for psy -
chiatrists to conduct a SCID on every patient seen by 
PCPs in a 3-month period. Therefore, the SCID inter -
views will be performed with all patients who received a 
mental health diagnosis by a PCP , as well as a subset of 
patients who did not receive a diagnosis, as mentioned 
above (see Fig. 4).
The psychiatrist is masked to the PCP diagnosis at the 
time of the SCID interview. After the SCID interview, 
the psychiatrist’s diagnosis will be used to categorize 
each patient into one of four groups: “true positives” = 
those patients who have the same diagnosis by the PCP 
and on the SCID; “false positives” = those patients who 
have a PCP diagnosis that is not confirmed on the SCID; 
“false negatives” = those patients who did not receive a 
PCP diagnosis, but who did receive a diagnosis on the 
SCID; and “true negatives” = those patients who were 
not diagnosed by a PCP and who did meet the criteria 
for any diagnosis on the SCID. We anticipate screening 
approximately 5500 patients in the primary care facili -
ties and having approximately 1100 evaluated in SCID 
interviews by the psychiatrist. See Additional file  1: Fig. 
S3 for the estimated breakdown for recruitment based on 
categorization for the estimated breakdown for recruit -
ment based on categorization according to PCP diagno -
ses, SCID interview outcomes and assumed sampling 
fractions. See Additional file  1 for details on secondary 
outcomes.
The participant timeline for PCPs and patients provides 
full details on when all instruments are administered 
(see Additional file  1: Table  S1). Instruments have been 
piloted with PCPs and patients, and the time needed for completion at different time points was deemed feasible 
and acceptable to participants in the pilot cRCT.
Recruitment
For objective 1, the participants are PCPs, and they will 
be recruited from the approximately 76 study  health 
facilities in 24 municipalities. For recruitment, train -
ing, and supervision of PCPs, we will work together with 
municipalities and their health coordinators. Through 
our qualitative findings from previous studies, the travel 
allowances mandated by the Nepal government for PCPs 
to attend trainings and supervision act as an incentive 
and motivational factor for their retention and continued 
service delivery in health programs. Hence, we plan to 
comply with the government mandate by providing these 
travel allowances.
For objective 2, patients are recruited by research assis -
tants at the primary care facility. For compensation, the 
patients will be provided with a household item such as 
soap, fruit, or a bag of sugar as a token of appreciation. 
This was deemed acceptable by PWLE and caregivers in 
the pilot cRCT.
Assignment of interventions: allocation and sequence 
generation
The planned cRCT will randomize 24 municipalities to 
either IAU or RESHAPE using covariate-constrained ran -
domization to achieve baseline covariate balance [117–
119]. The cRCT will involve multiple levels of clustering: 
municipalities, health facilities within municipalities, 
PCPs within health facilities, and, for the patient-related 
outcomes of objective 2, patients within PCPs. At the 
time of randomization, the 24 municipalities will be ran -
domized to either IAU or RESHAPE. Then, within each 
Fig. 4 Data collection pathway for primary care providers (PCPs) and patients (PT) in primary care facilities. Abbreviations: mhGAP , mental health 
Gap Action Programme; RESHAPE, Reducing Stigma Among Healthcare Providers; IAU, implementation-as-usual. Note: Because our study can only 
recruit a subsample of those who do not receive a PCP diagnosis (estimated to be 40% in both arms) and 3-month follow-up can only include 
sub-samples of recruited patients who did not receive a diagnosis from a PCP (expected to be 10% of those who are true negatives and 50% 
of those who are false negatives), the between-arm comparison applies to a population which, compared to the general health facility-visiting 
population, has an overrepresentation of those who screen positive (yellow color participants at 3 months in the figure)

municipality, all enrolled health facilities will receive 
the implementation specific to that arm (i.e., IAU vs. 
RESHAPE). Please see Additional file  1 for details on 
the concealment mechanism and implementation and 
assignment of interventions: masking and procedure for 
unmasking .
Plans for assessment, collection of outcomes, 
and promotion of retention and follow‑up
PCP outcomes will be assessed on the first day of train -
ing, the last day of training, 3 months post-training, 
and again at 6 months post-training. The multiple time 
points are to allow for comparisons of immediate and 
sustained changes. Qualitative interviews with a subset 
of PCPs will be conducted approximately 12 months after 
mhGAP trainings. Please see Additional file  1 for addi -
tional details on the collection of outcomes and details on 
the criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated inter -
ventions, adherence to interventions, concomitant care, 
and post-trial care.
Eligibility criteria
Cluster eligibility
We selected municipalities in consultation with the 
Nepal Epidemiology and Disease Control Division of the 
Ministry of Health and Population at the federal level, 
the Ministry of Health and Population and the Province 
Health Directorate at the provincial level, and munici -
palities at the local level. The municipalities selected are 
representative of most rural and peri-urban regions of 
Nepal. See Additional file  1 for details on the eligibility 
criteria for PCPs and patients, consent/assent procedures, 
confidentiality, and oversight and monitoring: data and 
safety monitoring board.
Sample size
The cRCT was designed with a minimum of 80% power 
for each of the two co-primary PCP outcomes (objec -
tive 1: stigma; objective 2: reach), respectively, at an 
overall 5% significance level. Given that we will consider 
RESHAPE a meaningful implementation strategy under 
the condition that both co-primary outcomes are statisti -
cally significant, we assumed a 5% two-tailed significance 
level for each outcome and calculated power using a 
closed-form sample size formula [120] that assumes that 
the generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach will 
be used for the analysis (identity link for stigma and log 
link for reach). For the purposes of these power calcula -
tions, we assumed the following sample sizes at each of 
the four levels: 24 municipalities randomized to one of 
two implementation arms (RESHAPE vs. IAU), 3 health 
facilities per municipality  (72 in total), and 3 PCPs per 
health facility  (of the total of 216, we assume 80% will provide data for objective 1 analyses at the 6-month 
timepoint).
For objective 2, we estimate that 1 PCP will deliver 
mental health services  per facility (a total of 72 PCPs), 
and each will recruit approximately 80 patients (total 
approximate sample 5760), of which approximately 16 are 
followed up at 3 months (total 1152, see Additional file  1: 
Fig. S3). We note that, in practice, some health facilities 
may have more than 1 PCP who delivers MH services. 
Sensitivity analyses show that power is still high in this 
case when the 80 patients are divided between 2 or more 
PCPs (see Additional file  1: Table S2 and Table S3). See 
Additional file  1 for additional details on the sample size, 
including assumptions on correlation parameters.
Statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes
The main analysis of our two co-primary outcomes will 
be based on the intention-to-treat principle whereby all 
PCPs (objective 1 stigma) and all participants (objective 2 
accurate diagnosis) will be included in the analysis in the 
study arm to which they were randomized irrespective 
of whether they complied with the assigned allocation 
of their municipality to one of the two implementation 
strategies (IAU and RESHAPE). Each analysis will be 
performed within the GEE framework paired with the 
matrix-adjusted equations (MAEE) approach [121]  with 
identity link for stigma and log-link for reach (i.e., accu -
racy). MAEE is an approach whereby a set of estimating 
equations is posited for the correlation parameters just 
as estimating equations are used for the outcome model 
to estimate the impact of the RESHAPE implementa -
tion strategy. Importantly, MAEE provides confidence 
intervals for pairwise correlation parameters, which is 
particularly useful for the planning of future studies. Cor -
rections such as the  Kauermann-Carroll adjustment to 
variance estimates will be used to avoid “small-sample” 
bias that may arise given that fewer than 40 clusters (i.e., 
municipalities) are randomized [120, 122].
The model for each outcome will include the imple -
mentation arm, the covariates included in the con -
strained randomization procedure, and a set of PCP 
covariates identified a priori as potential confounders 
(e.g., age, gender, and health worker qualification level). 
If additional important covariates are identified post hoc, 
additional sensitivity analyses will add those covariates 
to the model, particularly if they are, by chance, imbal -
anced between arms. Please see Additional file  1 for addi -
tional details on the statistical methods as well as details 
on the methods in analysis to handle protocol non-adher -
ence and any statistical methods to handle missing data, 
interim analyses, methods for additional analyses, access 
to data and statistical code, data management, and dis -
semination plans.

Discussion
There are multiple public health and scientific potential 
benefits of this study. With current detection rates of 
mental illness by mhGAP-trained PCPs at less than 10% 
globally, an implementation strategy capable of dou -
bling or tripling accurate detection would dramatically 
increase the number of people with mental illness enter -
ing care globally. With stigma from primary care workers 
against mental illness manifest as avoidance, discrimi -
nation, and reluctance to provide treatment, a success -
ful intervention to reduce stigma could transform the 
care-seeking experiences of patients and make mental 
healthcare in primary care a normative global practice. 
Moreover, it is a matter of principle to have more inclu -
sion of PWLE in the process of improving care.
Trial status
Recruitment and training of PCPs began in February 
2022, with patient recruitment planned to begin in June 
2022. The  Nepal Health Research Council conducted a 
study audit prior to the initiation of PCP trainings on 11 
February 2022.
