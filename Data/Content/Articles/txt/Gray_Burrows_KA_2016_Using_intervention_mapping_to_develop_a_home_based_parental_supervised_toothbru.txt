Abstract
Background: Dental caries in young children is a major public health problem impacting on the child and their
family in terms of pain, infection and substantial financial burden on healthcare funders. In the UK, national
guidance on the prevention of dental caries advises parents to supervise their child ’s brushing with fluoride
toothpaste until age 7. However, there is a dearth of evidence-based interventions to encourage this practice in
parents. The current study used intervention mapping (IM) to develop a home-based parental-supervised
toothbrushing intervention to reduce dental caries in young children.
Methods: The intervention was developed using the six key stages of the IM protocol: (1) needs assessment,
including a systematic review, qualitative interviews, and meetings with a multi-disciplinary intervention
development group; (2) identification of outcomes and change objectives following identification of the barriers to
parental-supervised toothbrushing (PSB), mapped alongside psychological determinants outlined in the Theoretical
Domains Framework (TDF); (3) selection of methods and practical strategies; (4) production of a programme plan;
(5) adoption and implementation and (6) Evaluation.
Results: The comprehensive needs assessment highlighted key barriers to PSB, such as knowledge, skills, self-
efficacy, routine setting and behaviour regulation and underlined the importance of individual, social and structural
influences. Parenting skills (routine setting and the ability to manage the behaviour of a reluctant child) were
emphasised as critical to the success of PSB. The multi-disciplinary intervention development group highlighted the
need for both universal and targeted programmes, which could be implemented within current provision. Two
intervention pathways were developed: a lower cost universal pathway utilising an existing national programme
and an intensive targeted programme delivered via existing parenting programmes. A training manual was created
to accompany each intervention to ensure knowledge and standardise implementation procedures.
Conclusions: PSB is a complex behaviour and requires intervention across individual, social and structural levels. IM,
although a time-consuming process, allowed us to capture this complexity and allowed us to develop two
community-based intervention pathways covering both universal and targeted approaches, which can be
integrated into current provision. Further research is needed to evaluate the acceptability and sustainability of these
interventions.

Background
Dental caries (tooth decay) is a worldwide public health
problem, with millions of children experiencing caries
in their primary teeth (the first set of teeth which erupt
at approximately 6 months of age and exfoliate between
the ages of 6 and 12 years old) [1, 2]. Moreover, there
are marked health inequalities, such that those of lower
socioeconomic status experience poorer oral health [3,
4]. In the UK, for example, an average of 31 % of 5-
year-old children have obvious dental caries, with this
figure increasing to 41 % in children from more de-
prived areas compared to 29 % living in more advan-
taged areas [5]. Caries is important to address as
experience at this young stage is a key predictor of fu-
ture oral health in adolescence and adulthood [6]. Den-
tal caries in young children has significant impacts on
health, social and intellectual development, including
pain, eating difficulties, speech impairments, and sig-
nificant morbidity to the child, and financial costs to
the family and society [7 –13].
Dental caries is preventable, and one key target behaviour
of ensuring good oral health for children is through twice
daily toothbrushing with fluoride toothpaste with supervi-
sion from a parent. UK guidelines recommend that from
the age of primary tooth eruption (approximately 6 months
old) up to the age of 7 years old, parents should supervise
their child ’s toothbrushing, known as parental-supervised
toothbrushing (PSB) [11, 14, 15]. This is a dyadic process
[16], which entails parents actively brushing their chil-
dren ’s teeth and children allowing their teeth to be
brushed; as such, it is a complex behaviour with many in-
fluences at both individual (parent and child separately)
and interpersonal levels (parent and child interactions).
Furthermore, PSB is a complex behaviour as it is com-
posed of a collection of behaviours beyond oral health
practices, such as parenting; and due to the various socio-
ecological influences on PSB, it can be a difficult behav-
iour to perform.
Evidence shows that PSB can lead to a 15 % reduction
in dental caries and when begun before the age of one
can double the chances of being free of obvious caries at
preschool age [17]. This reduction in caries is most
likely the result of the protection fluoride provides and
more effective plaque removal by parents [18, 19]. How-
ever, little advice is provided on what PSB means and
how to implement PSB, with few parents provided with
advice on how to brush the teeth of their young children
[16, 20, 21]. In addition, there is a lack of guidance for
healthcare workers, dental teams and nursery nurses on
how to support parents to implement PSB into their
child ’s daily lives [11, 14, 15]. Therefore, it is unsurpris-
ing that, 50 % of 5-year-olds in the UK brush their teeth
without supervision [18], with observational studies
reporting substantial inadequacies in the efficacy andfrequency of brushing [22], leading to a significantly
greater risk of developing dental caries [17, 23, 24].
Due to the rising concern of the problems caused by
dental caries in young children and the impact of this on
later life, there has been a drive to produce interventions to
improve oral health in children. These have been particularly
focused on school-based toot hbrushing programmes [13].
Evidence suggests that such interventions can be effective in
nursery and school settings [25, 26]. However, there are
problems with school-based interventions. First, they only
target children of a later age; thus, dental caries may already
be a significant problem before the intervention is available.
Second, the interventions pl ace extra burden on school staff.
Third, it has been suggested that these effects are not neces-
sarily maintained [27] and it is unclear whether school-
based brushing has an impact on home-based toothbrushing
[25]. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that school-based
toothbrushing programmes can have a detrimental effect on
home-based brushing as some parents perceive responsibil-
ity for brushing transferring to the role of the school [25].
Nevertheless, such interventions have been shown to signifi-
cantly reduce caries in permane nt teeth in high-risk children
recruited at 5 years old to a 2-year intervention and may be
one of the best ways of overcoming the barrier of cost of
dental resources for low -income families [28].
Home-based interventions have the advantage of tar-
geting PSB at an early age and habitualising important
oral health behaviours, but compared to school-based
interventions, programmes involving parents have been
investigated to a lesser extent. A recent review of 18 in-
terventions concluded that the majority were poorly de-
scribed, lacked a sound theoretical grounding, and
effects were mixed, with only 8/18 yielding any signifi-
cant results [29]. MRC guidance for the development of
complex interventions recommends the use of theory to
ensure that interventions target factors which are likely
to have an impact on the desired outcome and involve-
ment of stakeholders to ensure that interventions devel-
oped are feasible and acceptable [30]. Within the review
discussed previously, only five studies based interven-
tions on a theoretical framework; for example, Freu-
denthal and Bowen [31] and Weber-Gasparoni et al. ’s
[32] interventions were based on motivational theories,
including the Transtheoretical Model [33] and self-
determination theory [34], respectively, targeting behav-
iour change at the level of the individual. However, as re-
search has shown PSB is an interpersonal behaviour and
influenced by a range of factors not only beyond the indi-
vidual but also beyond motivation, thus, a more compre-
hensive approach is needed to target the barriers to PSB
at all levels of influence (individual, interpersonal and en-
vironmental). Within the UK, national guidance states
that future interventions need to use the wider workforce
in the community to deliver interventions to ensure theirGray-Burrows et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:61 Page 2 of 14
sustainability and implementation [13, 35, 36] and to de-
velop interventions which address the health inequalities
that persist in oral health [3, 4]. In order to achieve these
aims, it is necessary to include key stakeholders including
commissioners, health practitioners and community
members in the development of new interventions. There
is thus a clear need for the development of interventions
to promote PSB, which take into account theory, evidence
and context in their development.
It is vital to develop appropriate evidence-based inter-
ventions to encourage adoption of PSB, which are based
on sound evidence, and can be integrated within existing
delivery channels. Intervention mapping [37] is a proto-
col for the development of complex interventions, which
encompasses recommendations of the MRC guidance in
its approach. Specifically, it (i) takes into account theory
and evidence detailing how change is likely to occur, (ii)
takes an ecological perspective to the development
process and explicitly addresses individual, interpersonal,
organisational, community and societal influences on be-
haviours and outcomes and (iii) is grounded in commu-
nity participation allowing contributions from a range of
stakeholders to contribute to the development process.
Thus, it was deemed particularly suitable for development
of an intervention to addres s a complex behaviour such as
PSB with influences from multiple levels. Although it has
been used in a wide variety of other contexts including in-
creasing physical activity [38] and preventing childhood
obesity [39], it has never been applied to oral health behav-
iours, despite being recommended as a means of develop-
ing high-quality intervent ions to improve oral health
outcomes [40].
The aims of this paper were to describe how the IM
approach was used to develop a home-based parental-
supervised toothbrushing intervention to reduce dental
caries in young children and to explore the strengths
and limitations of this approach. We used the IM ap-
proach to develop an intervention which would be com-
plementary to existing service provision and improve
provisions, based on behaviour change theory, and de-
signed to target deprived communities in most need.
Methods
The IM process comprises of six steps: (1) needs assess-
ment; (2) identification of outcomes and change objec-
tives; (3) selection of methods and practical strategies; (4)
production of a programme plan; (5) adoption and imple-
mentation and (6) development of an evaluation plan.
Step 1: needs assessment
Intervention development group
In order to guide the process, a multi-disciplinary inter-
vention development group was convened. The inter-
vention development group ( n= 19) included parents,dental practitioners, community workers, local council-
lors, healthcare practitioners and academics. The group
was led by a behavioural scientist and met once a month
over a 4-month period to discuss oral health; barriers and
facilitators to PSB, including findings from the systematic
review and qualitative interviews (see below); and inter-
vention development (i.e. outcomes, delivery, practical
strategies and feasibility). Contact was additionally made
with organisations that could inform intervention design
and delivery (see Table 1 for the composition of the inter-
vention development group).
Systematic research review
A systematic review [29] was undertaken to identify all
the relevant literature on the prevalence of PSB, barriers
and facilitators to PSB and any home-based parent-
driven toothbrushing interventions in children up to the
age of 7. Database searches identified 3221 papers of
which 95 papers were included. In order to build the
limited existing application of theory in this area, we
mapped the barriers and facilitators of PSB identified in
the studies, as well as the barriers addressed in interven-
tion studies onto the Theoretical Domains Framework
(TDF) [41]. The TDF is a comprehensive list of 12 theor-
etical determinants of behaviour derived from 33 behav-
iour change theories and has been successfully used to
identify important theoretical determinants of behaviour
in a wide array of contexts.
Qualitative interviews
Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted
with parents/carers of children under 7 years ( n= 27).

Children under 7 were interviewed as “children need to
be helped or supervised by an adult when brushing until
at least seven years of age ”[15, 36]. Participants were
purposively sampled to ensure that parents living in de-
prived areas of Bradford and Barnsley (UK cities with
significant levels of deprivation and ethnic diversity)
ranged in gender, children ’s age, ethnicity, native lan-
guage, dental caries experience and dental attendance
patterns. Potential participants were identified from pre-
vious research projects, children ’s centres and commu-
nity dental clinics. Data saturation was reached after 27
interviews. Thirteen interviews took place at partici-
pants ’homes, 11 were conducted at a children ’s centre,
2 were conducted at a research institute and 1 interview
was conducted by telephone. Participants were 22
mothers, 2 fathers and 3 grandmothers. The aims of
these interviews were to explore the oral health behav-
iours of parents of young children and to identify thetheoretical barriers and facilitators to PSB. The inter-
views were based on the Theoretical Domains Frame-
work and analysed using framework analysis [41]. See
Table 2 for examples of how barriers were mapped onto
the different theoretical domains.
Step 2: identification of outcomes, performance
objectives and change objectives
The next step in the process involved the detailed speci-
fication of the desired outcomes for the intervention.
The overarching outcome of the current intervention
was to reduce dental caries in young children. The goal
of PSB is primarily to prevent caries in young children
and secondarily to prevent existing caries from getting
worse. All children are at risk for dental caries, and al-
though some children are at higher risk, for example
those with high levels of sugar in their diet, PSB is a be-
haviour that can be applied universally to support dental

health. Although not irrelevant, caries status is therefore
not a highly important factor in relation to the PSB be-
haviour. It was aimed to achieve this outcome by im-
proving oral health through the promotion of oral
health-related behaviours, primarily encouraging PSB.
However, it was recognised that there are numerous in-
fluences on PSB (e.g. individual, interpersonal, organisa-
tional/community and environmental); thus, specific
intervention outcomes were defined for each level of in-
fluence in line with the socio-ecological model [42] and
scrutinised by the research team and intervention devel-
opment group.
Following the specification of outcomes, performance
objectives for each of the specified outcomes were de-
fined. Performance objectives are a means of identifying
the precise behaviours that must occur to achieve the
specified outcomes. The final stage in this process re-
quired that the objectives of the intervention were stated
in terms of the actual changes that need to occur in the
theoretical determinants of behaviour. This is vital as it
allows the intervention developer to identify the exact
psychological constructs that need to change to have an
effect on the performance objective and the programme
outcome as a whole. Each performance objective was
scrutinised by behavioural scientists (KG-B, RM) to
identify the specific psychological determinants of be-
haviour useful in changing each performance objective.
This was achieved by reflecting on the barriers faced by
individuals to behavioural performance, which were
mapped using the TDF. For example, if a performance
objective was for parents to know what PSB means and
how to perform PSB, appropriate theoretical determinants
would be knowledge, skills and beliefs about capabilities
(self-efficacy). This process is useful as it encourages inter-
vention developers to precisely state what needs to be tar-
geted to affect the performance objective and select
appropriate evidence-based behaviour change techniques
to address the contributing psychological constructs iden-
tified. This process resulted in a matrix specifying the per-
formance objectives, the theoretical determinant of that
behaviour and change objectives.

methods deemed to be effective in changing theoretical de-
terminants. Theoretical methods/behaviour change tech-
niques [37, 43] were mapped against each determinant area
by two behavioural scientists (KG-B, RM). Change objec-
tives grouped under each determinant area were then oper-
ationalised into practical stra tegies. Practical intervention
strategies were developed by the research team including
behaviour change experts, with practical strategies identi-
fied in the systematic review [29], interviews [21], and bythe intervention development group. In addition, practical
strategies suggested by the team were shared with the inter-
vention development group to gauge the feasibility of these
strategies.
Step 4: creating an organised programme plan
In the next step, an organised programme plan was cre-
ated. This entailed outlining the scope and sequence of
the intervention components, materials and protocols.
The intervention development group and contact with
wider organisations provided guidance as to the scope
and implementation of the intervention. A large range of
change objectives and potential strategies were identified
at individual, commissioner and practitioner levels. The
change objectives and practical strategies were filtered
down to those that were feasible to target in the planned
intervention (e.g. at practitioner and individual level).
Step 5: creating an adoption and implementation plan
In the penultimate step, an adoption and implementation
plan was formulated in consultation with the intervention
development group. Consultations with key stakeholders re-
lated to health visiting services and parenting programmes
discussed how the interventions would be integrated within
their existing services, as well as how and when they would
be delivered and by whom. Training guides and lesson
plans were mapped out addressing key barriers to PSB for
health visitors and parenti ng programme facilitators.
Step 6: creating an evaluation plan
The last step of IM is to create an evaluation plan. This
step was not in the scope of the current paper and will
be reported elsewhere.
Results
Step 1: needs assessment
Identification of key barriers and facilitators
The systematic review conducted as part of this
programme of work aimed to identify theoretical determi-
nants useful in predicting and explaining PSB. Aliakbari et
al. [29] found wide variation in the prevalence of PSB. The
literature suggests that there are a range of barriers to
PSB, which were mapped onto the TDF. This mapping
process revealed that the main barriers fell into the theor-
etical categories of knowledge, beliefs about capabilities
(self-efficacy), beliefs about consequences (attitudes), be-
haviour regulation, social influences, environmental con-
text and resources, emotion and the nature of the
behaviours (See Table 2 for further detail on the frequency
of these barriers). For example, one key barrier is parental
self-efficacy. Many parents feel they lack the knowledge,
skills and confidence to appropriately brush their child ’s
teeth. Furthermore, in a number of studies, many parents
expressed that although they try to implement good oralGray-Burrows et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:61 Page 5 of 14
hygiene practices, they are faced with a difficult situation
where the child does not want to have their teeth brushed
by a parent, therefore leaving parents reticent to continue
with toothbrushing routine s. These barriers were fur-
ther borne out with the findings from Marshman et al.
[21], with the interviews revealing that parents were
knowledgeable about the importance of brushing
twice-a-day with fluoride toothpaste and the conse-
quences of developing dental caries. However, parents ’in-
terpretation of what ‘supervised brushing ’means was less
clear and in contradiction to the clinical guidelines mean-
ing. For instance, whilst parents brushed the teeth of their
children under 1 year of age, this was not continued up to
the recommended 7 years of age with difficulties reported
by parents gaining the child ’s co-operation. Facilitators to
PSB tended to be the reversal of these barriers; for ex-
ample, if a barrier was a lack of knowledge about PSB
guidelines and how to brush their children ’s teeth, a facili-
tator was improved knowledge of what PSB means and
how to perform PSB. However, other facilitators included
the use of rewards, such as sticker charts for children.
Using the TDF as a guide, we summarised the theoretical
determinants of PSB behaviours identified via our system-
atic review and qualitative research into a logical model
(see Fig. 1).Intervention development group
Discussions with the intervention development group and
wider organisations highlighted the importance of parent-
ing skills in the performance of toothbrushing behaviour,
particularly routine setting and behaviour management. In
addition, it was suggested that there is a need to consider
the wider family and culture and how family background
and experience can influence parents handling of their
child ’s oral health. Furthermore, the intervention develop-
ment group and wider organisations expressed that any
intervention targeting PSB would benefit from a non-
dental user-friendly setting that is interactive, including
various visual demonstrations and materials.
A number of key findings emerged from the needs as-
sessment that are summarised in Table 3. The needs as-
sessment led to the essential development of a logic
model identifying key areas to target and our strategic
short and long-term goals (Fig. 1). This process also
identified two potential vehicles of delivery for the inter-
vention: health visitors and parenting programmes.
The Healthy Child Programme is the government ’s
early intervention and prevention public health
programme delivered by heath visitors from 0 to 19 years
of age. One of the aims of this programme is to raise
awareness about children ’s oral health during the home
Fig. 1 Logic model for parental-supervised toothbrushing with focus on parenting programme-based interventionGray-Burrows et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:61 Page 6 of 14
developmental review sessions from 0 to 5 years of age
[35]. This was therefore seen as a universal means of de-
livering a PSB intervention. However, it was acknowl-
edged by the group that due to capacity limitations, such
an intervention would be unable to address all the bar-
riers to PSB, and indeed, barriers relating to parenting
skills would benefit from a targeted approach. Thus, par-
enting programmes were suggested as a vehicle of inter-
vention delivery for a targeted programme. Parenting
programmes (e.g. Henry, Incredible Years and Family
Links) are increasingly being commissioned and deliv-
ered in the community and broadly aim to improve the
health, social and emotional wellbeing of parents and
children by improving parenting skills. Therefore, this
existing context was seen as a positive means of promot-
ing both parenting and oral health skills. It resultantly
became clear that there were two possible intervention
pathways through the two different delivery vehicles: a
universal approach (health visitor delivered) and a tar-
geted approach (parenting programme delivered).
Step 2: identification of outcomes, performance
objectives and change objectives
The intervention development group agreed the overall
outcome of the current intervention should be to reduce
caries in young children. Using the socio-ecological
model [42], outcomes were specified at individual, inter-
personal, organisational/community and environmental
levels (see Table 4 for the specific outcomes).
The next stage of the process was to stipulate the per-
formance objectives for each of the specific programme
outcomes. This process was informed by theoreticalknowledge about the determinants of behaviour as spe-
cified in the TDF. This list was then scrutinised and vali-
dated by the research team. Twenty-nine performance
objectives and 117 accompanying change objectives were
identified. These objectives were examined by the re-
search team to assess which objectives required prioritis-
ing. Selected examples of change objectives for a sample
of performance objectives can be seen in Table 5.
Step 3: selecting methods and practical strategies
Examples of theoretical methods and practical strategies
related to motivation and goals change objectives can be
found in Table 6. For example, the change objectives in
this area relate to increasing motivation to perform PSB
and persist in the face of barriers that may emerge. The-
oretical methods deemed potentially useful were goals
and planning, prompts/cues and information on conse-
quences. Considering these theoretical determinants, it
was decided that practical strategies, such as using work-
books to allow parents to specify a series of implementa-
tion intentions regarding how, when and where they will
perform PSB and encouraging the use of reminders and
environmental cues to prompt PSB may be useful. Fur-
thermore, the use of group discussion, workbook activ-
ities, video vignettes and leaflets can be used to convey
the costs and benefits of engaging in PSB vs. not en-
gaging in PSB.
Step 4: creating an organised programme plan
The next stage required deciding on the scope and limi-
tations of the intervention, translating the practical strat-
egies into programme components and identifying
methods of delivery that would be feasible and able to
be implemented within existing provisions. A key barrier
identified by the intervention development group related
to effective parenting skills (particularly managing child
behaviour), thus highlighting that a wider range of skills
are needed beyond basic oral hygiene to effectively
undertake PSB, skills that are not addressed by current
oral health promotion activities. Parenting programmes
offer the opportunity to provide more focused and in-
tensive intervention, but they can be time-consuming
and costly and thus not available as a universal interven-
tion. Therefore, two intervention pathways were devel-
oped (Fig. 2). The first consisted of augmenting standard
health visitor practice with additional materials targeting
key barriers and the provision of further training to
existing health visiting teams who currently deliver the
universal Healthy Child Programme [35] to enable them
to effectively intervene. This enabled the programme to
be delivered universally to parents of all children. The
second pathway included a more intensive targeted
programme focused on building skills, particularly those
relating to wider parenting skills, such as routine settingTable 3 Key lessons learnt from needs assessment
Key lessons learnt about barriers/facilitators and intervention content
and delivery
Need to educate parents as lack of parent -targeted oral health programmes
currently.
Education on oral health needs to begin early in a child life.
Family background, including parents own oral health, and the influence of
the extended family and culture can have an impact on oral health.
Need to emphasise the personal respon sibility of parents to take care of
child ’so r a lh e a l t h .
Need to highlight dental caries preventable and show consequences of
brushing vs. not brushing.
Oral health messages need to be consistent.
Intervention needs to be user-frien dly, fun and interactive (e.g. peer
support, use of videos, practical demonstrations, phone Apps and novelty
toothbrushes).
Wider parenting skills (e.g., routine setting and behaviour management)
highly important to toothbrushing behaviour.
Language barriers and cultural sensitivity are key considerations in the
development of an intervention.
Signposting to existing services would be useful to parents.
Interventions should be delivered through existing community services
(e.g. health visitors, children ’s centres).
Parenting programmes are a potential means of addressing wider parenting
skills and delivering an intervention w ith an existing community provision.Gray-Burrows et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:61 Page 7 of 14
and behaviour management. The delivery of this inter-
vention programme would be through parenting pro-
grammes. Targeted sessions were needed that could be
either ‘woven into ’or ‘bolted onto ’existing parenting
programmes and would focus on PSB.
The aim of the first intervention pathway would be to pro-
vide health visitors with enhanced oral health training and
supportive materials (an aid memoire) to ensure standar-
dised provision of oral health advice, with a focus on PSB.
For parents, the intervention emphasis is placed on develop-
ing their knowledge, skills, positive attitudes and confidence
specifically relating to child o ral health and PSB. In addition,
parents will be provided with a dental pack including a
toothbrush, toothpaste and leaflet, as well as being directed
to web-based video clips to further support their skill devel-
opment. Such additional materi al is vital to facilitate further
learning and skills development beyond the session as health
visitors operate within strict time limits with a wide range of
other developmental and parenting issues to be covered.
Thus, due to capacity limitations, this intervention would ad-
dress a proportion of the barriers to PSB. For example, par-
enting skills have been emphasised as key to the
p e r f o r m a n c eo fP S B ,b u td u et ot i m er e s t r i c t i o n s ,s u c hab a r -
rier could only be briefly discussed.
The second intervention pathway aims to address
wider parenting skills as well as oral hygiene skills by de-
livering sessions that are embedded within existing par-
enting programmes. Currently, parenting programmes
cover numerous parenting skills, including routine set-
ting and child behaviour management. The sessions will
target all the barriers identified to PSB, with particular
emphasis on the barriers that emerge at three key time
points in a child ’s life between the age of 0 and 7 (tooth
eruption (~6 months), 2 years and preschool age). These
barriers being routine initiation, knowledge and skill de-
velopment and behaviour management. Sessions would
be led by a parenting programme facilitator; however,
the session would be interactive with group discussion
where parents identify their own barriers to PSB andidentify strategies to overcome these barriers being a key
component. These discussions would be further sup-
ported via practical demonstrations and in session prac-
tice of toothbrushing, group exercises based within a
workbook and the display of video vignettes to stimulate
discussion and problem-solving. In addition, parents
would also receive a dental pack (toothbrush, toothpaste
and leaflet) and have access to a website that would
serve as a home for all the material delivered within the
sessions that parents can access in their own time to fur-
ther consolidate their skill development. Indeed, parents
would be actively encouraged to practise what they have
learnt at home and spread their learning to other family
members and the wider community, with the second
session allowing parents to report back on their progress
and discuss difficulties encountered. Owing to the sup-
portive nature of parenting programmes, parents with
their peers can be guided to find a method which works
for their children whilst ensuring appropriate oral health
practices are adopted.
Training manuals have been created to accompany
each intervention to ensure knowledge and standardise
implementation procedures. The training for both inter-
ventions addresses the barriers to PSB of motivations
and goals, knowledge, beliefs about consequences and
capabilities, social influences, including social role and
identity, and environmental context and resources. How-
ever, the targeted intervention training expands on this
by also addressing the barriers of skills, behaviour regu-
lation and the nature of the behaviour.
Step 5: creating an adoption and implementation plan
As previously mentioned, it has been recommended that
future oral health promotion interventions should aim
to utilise the existing childhood workforce to provide a
community-based intervention [13, 35, 36]. Therefore,
with regard to the universal intervention, it was decided
to deliver the intervention through health visitors that
already have regular contact with parents and cover oralTable 4 Specific intervention outcomes by socio-ecological level

health albeit briefly within their existing provisions. In
respect to the targeted programme delivered through
parenting programmes, it was decided that the parenting
programme facilitators would be best placed to deliver
the intervention. Using existing facilitators confers a
number of benefits, as facilitators: (1) are familiar with
delivering an evidence-based programme, (2) are familiar
with the local community and able to build a rapport
with parents and (3) the intervention would be imple-
mented within an existing community service, therefore
increasing sustainability. The next stage of this process
will be to define the clinical and process outcome mea-
sures for the intervention and to evaluate the feasibility
of the two intervention pathways.
Discussion
This paper aimed to describe in detail the process of
using an IM approach to developing a home-based
parental-supervised toothbrushing intervention to re-
duce dental caries in young children and to explore the
strengths and limitations of this approach. This oral
health intervention, to our knowledge, is the first to use
an IM approach that incorporates evidence based on re-
view, interview and stakeholder data, behaviour change
theory, and has been co-developed with community and
stakeholder input. Although the intervention has been
developed within a UK context, the lessons learnt from
using the IM process have relevance for researchers and
practitioners internationally, especially considering thecurrent paucity of evidence-based interventions and
their failure to address all barriers to PSB.
The intervention process has identified the multiple bar-
riers to PSB adoption by parents. The two proposed inter-
ventions (universal and targeted) provide differing levels
of support. This design acknowledges that for some par-
ents, the more targeted help is required for them to adopt
PSB. Further work will be needed to identify which groups
of parents need the different approaches and the efficacy
of these interventions. We identified two key pathways
which fit in with existing provision within the UK of
health services to children and families: first, a universal
intervention that enables key health professionals (i.e.
health visitors) to help parents overcome key barriers to
performing appropriate parental-supervised brushing in
line with clinical guidelines. This involves the provision of
training for health visitors and the provision of materials
to parents. This lower cost intervention can be imple-
mented within the current Healthy Child Programme
pathway and thus has potential for high reach and scal-
ability. Second, in recognition of the wider context in
which toothbrushing takes place and the key role of par-
enting skills, a targeted programme embedded within par-
enting programmes run within existing community
settings has been developed. These sessions not only ad-
dress improving knowledge and skills related to PSB, but
also wider parenting skills by utilising the teachings of the
parenting programmes.
Both intervention pathways address key barriers to
PSB among parents of young children using theoreticallyTable 6 Examples of strategies for motivation and goals change objectives

underpinned behaviour change techniques, though the
universal intervention is limited in the number of bar-
riers it addresses compared to the targeted intervention.
The targeted programme has the advantage of address-
ing wider parenting skills, and this is vitally important as
increasingly research is showing parenting skills to be
fundamental to oral health practices.
Through our own needs assessm ent, our intervention de-
velopment group expressed the invaluable nature of good
parenting skills, and indeed, the systematic review we
undertook identified parenting skills as a prominent deter-
minant of toothbrushing practi ces [29]. Furthermore, recent
qualitative research on PSB w ith parents has emphasised
the fundamentality of parenting skills [16, 21]. The main
barrier related to managing the behaviour of the child, as
children displayed resistance to letting their parent carry
out toothbrushing. Therefore, to ensure children ’s teeth are
cleaned sufficiently, parents must learn behaviour manage-
ment skills to negotiate what can be a difficult encounter,
which is a key component of all parenting programmes.
Moreover, these issues highli ght the importance of framing
our specific outcomes for our interventions using the socio-
ecological model, as to effect behaviour change, we clearly
must look beyond the individual. PSB is an interpersonal
activity between parent(s) and child; thus, any intervention
must consider the relationship between them and the na-
ture of their interaction, wh ilst acknowledging the wider
community and environmenta l influences on behaviour.
Despite this evidence, as of yet, there has been no devel-
oped collaborative progra mmes covering both areas. As
such, testing the effectiveness of such a comprehensive ap-
proach to intervention design will be crucial. Further re-
search is needed to assess recruitment, attendance and
attrition rate, acceptability of the interventions to parents
and practitioners, implementation fidelity, and feasibility of
evaluation measures.
Our study has a number of strengths. Our work repre-
sents a major contribution to the field of oral health devel-
opment, as it is the first, to our knowledge, which has
systematically developed an intervention based on sound
evidence and theory. We engaged with a committed and
varied group of stakeholders, including parents, commis-
sioners, health practitioners and voluntary sector health or-
ganisations representing key disadvantaged groups. This
enabled us to develop a feasible intervention which can be
weaved into existing child h ealth delivery channels. We
found a number of strengths of using the IM approach, par-
ticularly, explicitly incorpor ating theory and evidence, and
guidance on how to develop the intervention in partnership
with local stakeholders. However, there are some limita-
tions, both with the process of intervention mapping and
the developed interventions which should be highlighted.
With regard to the intervention mapping process, as
others have highlighted [38, 39, 44], IM is a time-consuming process and can become cumbersome when
considering complex behaviou rs. The entire process took
4 months, with one full time researcher managing the
process. The data created during the protocol can become
unwieldy. For example, in the current study, we generated
6 programme outcomes, 29 performance objectives and
117 change objectives. We foun d it difficult to communi-
cate this level of detail and complexity with our interven-
tion development group. In order to deal with this
challenge, we found that some element of reflexivity is re-
quired to filter and prioritise performance objectives and
change objectives into a manageable number. In the
current project, we did this th rough discussion between the
research team, consultation with the intervention develop-
ment group and with organisations that would be respon-
sible for the implementation of the interventions. In
addition, the emphasis on theory (identifying determinants
and theoretical methods) in steps 2 and 3 of the process
means that input of those with experience of behaviour
change methodology is vital. T hose wishing to use this ap-
proach in future should ensure that this relevant expertise
is available prior to embarking on this process. Moreover, it
is not possible to know at the outset what the final inter-
vention programme will look like. This means that further
research or needs assessment may be required during later
stages of planning, if development takes an unexpected
course. For example, early on our intervention group iden-
tified the importance of the role of parenting as a key pre-
cursor to ability to engage in PSB. This necessitates further
detailed work mapping existing parenting programme
provision and exploring willingness of programmes to en-
gage with additional oral health modules. This required
substantial additional resou rces and time. Whilst IM expli-
citly acknowledges the reflex ivity of the process (allowing
intervention development groups to move forwards and
backwards along the process), it is important to be aware of
challenges when adhering to planned time scales.
It is important to acknowledge that the current inter-
ventions are not without their limitations. With regard
to the universal intervention, it has to be acknowledged
that these services are already operating with a stretched
capacity. This has been taken into account in the devel-
opment of this intervention, with enhancement of these
services falling largely into the provision of improved
materials that can be given to parents. However, this
means that not all the barriers to PSB are adequately ad-
dressed by this intervention, predominantly motivation,
routine setting and behaviour regulation. In contrast, the
targeted intervention does tackle all the relevant barriers
but nevertheless presents challenges. The main challenge
relates to the delivery settings of parenting programmes
and their capability to deliver to all communities includ-
ing those where parents may not speak English. A
strength of the targeted PSB intervention is thatGray-Burrows et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:61 Page 12 of 14
parenting programmes tend to be located in deprived
areas and are thus well placed to help families whose
children are most at risk from caries.
Questions about reach, deliverability, uptake, success
and generalisability of both the universal and targeted
interventions will be fully investigated in our planned
programme of research. This research will clarify the as-
sumptions which underpin our logic model and clarify
our theory of change. In summary, the intervention aims
to support PSB adoption (and thus reduction in caries),
by increasing motivation, and targeting key individual,
interpersonal and skill-based and context-based determi-
nants of behaviour.
Conclusions
The current paper reports the development of a home-
based parental-supervised toothbrushing intervention
aiming to reduce dental caries in young children. It rep-
resents the first attempt to systematically apply evidence
and theory in the development of an intervention in this
context and was explicitly designed to integrate with
existing delivery channels. We found intervention map-
ping to be useful, although not without its challenges.
We recommend that groups using this methodology en-
sure appropriate input from an experienced multi-
disciplinary group, including expertise on behaviour
change theory, and that adequate time is built into time-
lines to allow for reflexivity in IM stages.
