Abstract
Background: Implementation fidelity refers to the degr ee to which an intervention or programme
is delivered as intended. Only by understandin g and measuring whether an intervention has been
implemented with fidelity can researchers and pra ctitioners gain a better und erstanding of how and
why an intervention works, and the exte nt to which outcomes can be improved.
Discussion: The authors undertook a critical review  of existing conceptualisations of
implementation fidelity and developed a new conceptual framework for understanding and
measuring the process. The result ing theoretical framework requires testing by empirical research.
Summary: Implementation fidelity is an important source  of variation affecting the credibility and
utility of research. The conceptual framework pr esented here offers a means for measuring this
variable and understanding its place in th e process of intervention implementation.
Background
Implementation fidelity is "the degree to which . . . pro-
grams are implemented . . . as intended by the program
developers" [1]. This idea is sometimes also termed
"integrity" [1,2]. Implementation fidelity acts as a poten-
tial moderator of the relationship between interventions
and their intended outcomes. That is to say, it is a factor
that may impact on the relationship between these two
variables ( i.e., how far an intervention actually affects out-
comes. This is one of the principal reasons why imple-
mentation fidelity needs to be measured. It has been
demonstrated that the fidelity with which an intervention
is implemented affects how well it succeeds [1-5]. For
instance, two studies examining programmes to help peo-
ple with mental health issues obtain employment found
that employment outcomes among their study groupswere weakest for those in poorly implemented pro-
grammes [6,7]. In the same way, a study of a parent train-
ing programme found that when the programme was
implemented with high fidelity, the parenting practices
improved significantly, but the effect was much less when
implementation fidelity was low [8]. Other recent studies
have found similar associations [9,10].
It is only by making an appropriate evaluation of the fidel-
ity with which an intervention has been implemented that
a viable assessment can be made of its contribution to
outcomes, i.e., its effect on performance. Unless such an
evaluation is made, it cannot be determined whether a
lack of impact is due to poor implementation or inade-
quacies inherent in the programme itself, a so-called Type
III error [11]; this is also addressed by the thesis of com-Published: 30 November 2007

positive outcomes produced by an intervention might be
improved still further, if it were found that it had not been
implemented fully.
Primary research into interventions and their outcomes
should therefore involve an evaluation of implementa-
tion fidelity if the true effect of the intervention is to be
discerned. Moreover, evidence-based practitioners also
need to be able to understand and quantify the fidelity
with which they are implementing an intervention. Evi-
dence-based practice assumes that an intervention is
being implemented in full accordance with its published
details. This is particularly important given the greater
potential for inconsistencies in implementation of an
intervention in real world rather than experimental condi-
tions. Evidence-based practice therefore not only needs
information from primary researchers about how to
implement the intervention, if replication of the interven-
tion is to be at all possible, it also needs a means of eval-
uating whether the programme is actually being
implemented as the designers intended.
Similar issues affect secondary research: the common lack
of data on implementation fidelity provided by primary
research studies, known as "thinness", prevents those
working on systematic reviews and meta-analyses from
gauging possible heterogeneity between studies, with the
result that data may be pooled or aggregated inappropri-
ately [13,14]. Consequently, the internal validity of a
review may be adversely affected, and, thus, the credibility
and utility of that research may be thrown into question.
The degree of implementation fidelity achieved by an
intervention may also explain why some studies generate
different results, even though they appear to be the same
in every other way.
In summary, evaluation of implementation fidelity is
important because this variable may not only moderate
the relationship between an intervention and its out-
comes, but its assessment may also prevent potentially
false conclusions from being drawn about an interven-
tion's effectiveness. It may even help in the achievement
of improved outcomes. It can give primary researchers
confidence in attributing outcomes to the intervention;
evidence-based practitioners can be confident they are
implementing the chosen intervention properly; and sec-
ondary researchers can be more confident when synthesis-
ing studies. This all requires a framework within which to
understand and measure the concept and process of
implementation fidelity. Accordingly, the objective of this
paper is to critically review the literature on implementa-
tion fidelity, particularly within primary research – the
implementation of an intervention – and to propose anew framework for understanding and evaluating this
concept.
Conceptualisations of implementation fidelity and their 
limitations
A search was performed to identify literature on imple-
mentation fidelity, i.e., empirical research, reviews, or the-
oretical pieces. The following databases were searched
with the terms "implementation fidelity" or "fidelity"
within five words of "implement", "implementation",
"implemented", etc.: Applied Social Sciences Index and
Abstracts, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health
Literature (CINAHL), International Bibliography of the
Social Sciences, MEDLINE, and the Social Science Citation
Index. The relevant studies identified by this search were
also then scanned for additional literature. Conference
abstracts and presentations provided another source of lit-
erature in this field. This multi-method search identified a
number of reviews discussing the conceptualisation of
implementation fidelity, and a body of empirical research
measuring the fidelity with which various interventions
had been implemented. This article focuses principally on
research published from 2002 to 2007, because of the
presence of major reviews of the implementation fidelity
literature from 2003 and before [1,2,4,5]. The arguments,
limitations, and findings of all of this literature contrib-
uted to the development of the novel framework pre-
sented here and provided examples of how to evaluate
individual elements of the framework.
A conceptual framework: Background and Rationale
The concept of implementation fidelity is currently
described and defined in the literature in terms of five ele-
ments that need to be measured [1,2,4]. These are: adher-
ence to an intervention; exposure or dose; quality of
delivery; participant responsiveness; and programme dif-
ferentiation. There are certain overlaps here with the con-
cept of process evaluation [15]. Within this
conceptualisation of implementation fidelity, adherence
is defined as whether "a program service or intervention is
being delivered as it was designed or written" [4]. Dosage
or exposure refers to the amount of an intervention
received by participants; in other words, whether the fre-
quency and duration of the intervention is as full as pre-
scribed by its designers [1,4]. For example, it may be that
not all elements of the intervention are delivered, or are
delivered less often than required. Coverage may also be
included under this element, i.e., whether all the people
who should be participating in or receiving the benefits of
an intervention actually do so.
Quality of delivery is defined as "the manner in which a
teacher, volunteer, or staff member delivers a program"
[4]. However, it is perhaps a more ambiguous element
than this suggests. An evaluation of this may require using
Implementation Science  2007, 2:40 http://www.implementation science.com/content/2/1/40
Page 3 of 9
(page number not for citation purposes)a benchmark, either within or beyond that stipulated by
an intervention's designers; this element of fidelity could
involve either delivering the intervention using "tech-
niques . . . prescribed by the program" [4], or applying a
benchmark from outside the programme, i.e., "the extent
to which a provider approaches a theoretical ideal in
terms of delivering program content" [1]. If such a clear
benchmark exists then quality of delivery may be treated,
along with adherence and dosage, as one of three discrete
aspects required to assess the fidelity of an intervention.
However, it may potentially also be viewed as a moderator
of the relationship between an intervention and the fidel-
ity with which it is implemented. This is a role that is sim-
ply not explored in the literature to date. For example, an
intervention could be delivered but delivered badly; in
turn, the degree of fidelity achieved by the implemented
intervention could be adversely affected.
Participant responsiveness measures how far participants
respond to, or are engaged by, an intervention. It involves
judgments by participants or recipients about the out-
comes and relevance of an intervention. In this sense,
what is termed "reaction evaluation" in the evaluation lit-
erature may be considered an important part of any eval-
uation of an intervention [16].
Program differentiation, the fifth aspect, is defined as
"identifying unique features of different components or
programs", and identifying "which elements of . . . pro-
grammes are essential", without which the programme
will not have its intended effect [1]. Despite being viewed
as an element of implementation fidelity by the literature,
programme differentiation actually measures something
distinct from fidelity. It is concerned with determining
those elements that are essential for its success. This exer-
cise is an important part of any evaluation of new inter-
ventions. It enables discovery of those elements that make
a difference to outcomes and whether some elements are
redundant. Such so-called "essential" elements may be
discovered either by canvassing the designers of the inter-
vention or, preferably, by "component analysis", assess-
ing the effect of the intervention on outcomes and
determining which components have the most impact
[17]. This element would therefore be more usefully
described as the "Identification of an intervention's essen-
tial components". This process may also have implica-
tions for implementation fidelity; if, for example, these
essential components are the most difficult to implement,
then this may then explain a lack of success afflicting the
intervention.
Despite agreeing that implementation fidelity involves
measurement of these five elements, the review literature
offers two distinct views on how this should be done. On
the one hand, it is argued that each of these five elementsrepresents an alternative way to measure fidelity, i.e.,
implementation fidelity can be measured using either
adherence or dosage or quality of delivery etc [4,5]. On
the other hand, it is argued that all five elements need to
be measured to capture a "comprehensive" or "more com-
plete picture" of the process, i.e., evaluation requires the
measurement of adherence, dosage, and quality of deliv-
ery, etc [1,2]. However, relationships between the various
elements are far more complex than such conceptualisa-
tions allow. This paper therefore advances a new, third
conceptual framework for implementation fidelity, which
not only proposes the measurement of all of these ele-
ments, but unlike all previous attempts to make sense of
this concept also clarifies and explains the function of
each and their relationship to one another. Two addi-
tional elements are also introduced into this new frame-
work: intervention complexity and facilitation strategies.
The potential effect of intervention complexity on imple-
mentation fidelity was suggested to the authors by litera-
ture on implementation more broadly – especially a
systematic review that focused on identifying facilitators
and barriers to the diffusion of innovations in organisa-
tions that found that the complexity of an idea presented
a substantial barrier to its adoption [18]. The potential
role of facilitation strategies was suggested by research
aiming to evaluate the implementation fidelity of specific
interventions that put in place strategies to optimise the
level of fidelity achieved. Such strategies included the pro-
vision of manuals, guidelines, training, monitoring and
feedback, capacity building, and incentives [3,6,8,17].
Proposed framework
All of the elements to evaluate implementation fidelity are
listed in Table 1, and the relationships between them are
shown in the framework depicted in Figure 1.
The framework outlined in Figure 1 depicts the vital ele-
ments of implementation fidelity and their relationship to
one another. The measurement of implementation fidel-
ity is the measurement of adherence, i.e., how far those
responsible for delivering an intervention actually adhere
to the intervention as it is outlined by its designers. Adher-
ence includes the subcategories of content, frequency,
duration and coverage ( i.e., dose). The degree to which the
intended content or frequency of an intervention is imple-
mented is the degree of implementation fidelity achieved
for that intervention. The level achieved may be influ-
enced or affected, ( i.e., moderated) by certain other varia-
bles: intervention complexity, facilitation strategies,
quality of delivery, and participant responsiveness. For
example, the less enthusiastic participants are about an
intervention, the less likely the intervention is to be imple-
mented properly and fully.
Implementation Science  2007, 2:40 http://www.implementation science.com/content/2/1/40

(page number not for citation purposes)The broken line in Figure 1 indicates that the relationship
between an intervention and its outcomes is external to
implementation fidelity, but that the degree of implemen-
tation fidelity achieved can affect this relationship.
Finally, an analysis of outcomes may identify those com-
ponents that are essential to the intervention, and must be
implemented if the intervention is to have its intended
effects. This evaluation in turn may inform the content of
the intervention by determining the minimum require-
ments for high implementation fidelity, i.e., the imple-mentation of the essential components of the
intervention. The following discussion describes the func-
tion of each element in detail, highlighted by examples
from the research. Relationships between moderators are
also considered.
A conceptual framework: el ements and relationships
Adherence
Adherence is essentially the bottom-line measurement of
implementation fidelity. If an implemented intervention
adheres completely to the content, frequency, duration,
and coverage prescribed by its designers, then fidelity can
be said to be high. Measuring implementation fidelity
means evaluating whether the result of the implementa-
tion process is an effective realisation of the intervention
as planned by its designers.
The content of the intervention may be seen as its 'active
ingredients'; the drug, treatment, skills, or knowledge that
the intervention seeks to deliver to its recipients. For
example, the Marriage and Parenting in Stepfamilies par-
ent training programme is based on thirteen sessions,
each with specific materials to be delivered to parents by
trained educators [8]. The programme has a number of
designated components, such as skill encouragement and
discipline. The fidelity with which this intervention was
implemented, i.e., the level of adherence to its model, was
evaluated by trained coders using videotapes of sessionsTable 1:

(page number not for citation purposes)to score how far the implemented intervention actually
adhered to the prescribed model in terms of content [8].
The tool used in this study was the Fidelity of Implemen-
tation Rating System (FIMP). Observation by trained staff
of those delivering the intervention is often used to evalu-
ate fidelity [19,20].
Subcategories of adherence concern the frequency, dura-
tion, or coverage of the intervention being delivered, i.e.,
what is more broadly defined as "dose" in the existing lit-
erature. For example, one violence prevention programme
used interviews and surveys with staff to determine
whether the intervention had been implemented as often
and for as long as prescribed, and found that high imple-
mentation fidelity was only achieved in a little over one-
half of cases [3]. In the same way, an evaluation of the
implementation of a residential treatment programme for
adolescents with substance abuse issues required staff to
keep a log of the number of hours of services provided by
the Adolescent Treatment Program, and this was com-
pared with the number of hours prescribed by the inter-
vention's model [21]. Implementation fidelity was found
to be relatively low, with only about one-half of the
required time being spent in the activities prescribed by
the intervention.
The measurement of adherence to an intervention's pre-
defined components can therefore be quantifiable: An
evaluation to gauge how much of the intervention's pre-
scribed content has been delivered, how frequently, and
for how long. However, adherence may not require every
single component of an intervention to be implemented.
An intervention may also be implemented successfully,
and meaningfully, if only the "essential" components of
the model are implemented. However, the question
remains about how to identify what is essential. One pos-
sible way to do this is to conduct a sensitivity analysis, or
"component analysis", using implementation fidelity
data and performance outcomes from different studies of
the same intervention to determine which, if any, compo-
nents or combination of components are essential, i.e., are
prerequisite if the intervention is to have its desired effect.
However, if essential components of an intervention are
not known, then fidelity to the whole intervention is
needed.
Identifying these essential components also provides
scope for identifying adaptability to local conditions. An
intervention cannot always be implemented fully in the
real world. Local conditions may require it to be flexible
and adaptable. Some specifications of interventions allow
for local adaptation. Even if they do not explicitly do this,
local adaptations may be made to improve the fit of the
intervention within the local context. Indeed, the pro-
adaptation perspective implies that successful interven-tions are those that adapt to local needs [22]. However,
some argue that the case for local adaptation may well
have been exaggerated, at least for interventions where the
evidence does not necessarily support it [3]. The interme-
diate position is therefore that programme implementa-
tion can be flexible as long as there is fidelity to the so-
called "essential" elements of an intervention. The
absence of these elements would have significant adverse
effects on the capacity of an intervention to achieve its
goals. Indeed, without them it cannot meaningfully be
said that an intervention has achieved high implementa-
tion fidelity.
Moderators
A high level of adherence or fidelity to an intervention, or
its essential components, is not achieved easily. Several
factors may influence or moderate the degree of fidelity
with which an intervention is implemented. Each of the
potential moderators of this relationship is now consid-
ered in turn.
Intervention complexity
The description of an intervention may be simple or com-
plex, detailed or vague. Detailed or specific interventions
have been found to be more likely to be implemented
with high fidelity than ones that are vague. For example, a
study of guidelines intended for General Practitioners
(GPs) found that detailed and clear recommendations
were almost twice as likely to be followed as vague and
non-specific recommendations [23]. The specificity of
these guidelines was assessed by a group of researchers
and their uptake was evaluated by the GPs' self-report. In
the same way, well-planned interventions, where all the
key components are identified in advance, have been
found to produce higher levels of adherence than less
well-structured interventions [1,5]. Specificity enhances
adherence.
There is also evidence that it is easier to achieve high fidel-
ity of simple than complex interventions [1]. This may be
because there are fewer "response barriers" when the
model is simple [18]. Complex interventions have greater
scope for variation in their delivery, and so are more vul-
nerable to one or more components not being imple-
mented as they should. This has led to calls in some
quarters for improving the recording and reporting of
complex interventions to identify and address potential
sources of heterogeneity in implementation [13,14,24].
Overall, research suggests that simple but specific inter-
ventions are more likely to be implemented with high
fidelity than overly complex or vague ones. As such, the
comprehensiveness and nature of an intervention's
description may influence how far the programme suc-
cessfully adheres to its prescribed details when imple-
mented.

(page number not for citation purposes)Facilitation strategies
Support strategies may be used both to optimise and to
standardise implementation fidelity, i.e., to ensure that
everyone is receiving the same training and support, with
the aim that the delivery of the intervention is as uniform
as possible [25]. Such strategies include the provision of
manuals, guidelines, training, and monitoring and feed-
back for those delivering the intervention.
Some studies that evaluate the implementation process
have monitored the extent to which an intervention is
being implemented correctly, and then have fed back
these results to those delivering the intervention. A study
measuring fidelity to an exercise programme for women
with hip fractures used direct observation by the designers
of the intervention to monitor the intervention that was
actually being delivered, and then provided feedback to
the exercise trainers [21]. In this way, deviations from the
intended content of the programme were addressed and
corrected, and high fidelity was achieved.
It is therefore possible that these strategies, like the nature
of an intervention's description, may potentially moder-
ate the degree of fidelity achieved: the more that is done
to help implementation, through monitoring, feedback,
and training, the higher the potential level of implemen-
tation fidelity achieved. The role of such strategies in opti-
mising fidelity and standardising what is being
implemented is arguably even more important in the case
of complex interventions, which can be multifaceted and
therefore more vulnerable to variation in their implemen-
tation [24]. Although some studies have claimed that the
provision of certain facilitation strategies has positively
affected implementation of an intervention, these claims
are not the result of empirical research [13]. However, no
study has yet measured the moderating effect of these
strategies on the degree of implementation fidelity.
More facilitation strategies do not necessarily mean better
implementation. A simple intervention may require very
little in terms of training or guidance to achieve high
implementation fidelity. A complex intervention by con-
trast may require extensive support strategies. There is
therefore an issue of adequacy, and this may be deter-
mined by the relationship between facilitation strategies
and the complexity of an intervention's description. The
relationship between these potential moderators is dis-
cussed more fully below. Empirical research has yet to
demonstrate whether facilitation strategies can indeed
affect how well or how badly an intervention is imple-
mented, but this should certainly be considered as a
potential moderator of implementation fidelity.Quality of delivery
Quality of delivery is an obvious potential moderator of
the relationship between an intervention and the fidelity
with which it is implemented. It concerns whether an
intervention is delivered in a way appropriate to achieving
what was intended. If the content of an intervention is
delivered badly, then this may affect the degree to which
full implementation is realised. In studies evaluating
fidelity the provision of extensive training, materials and
support to those delivering an intervention is an implicit
acknowledgement that effort is required to optimise the
quality of the delivery of the intervention being evaluated
[3,26-28]. In the same way, quality assurance or improve-
ment strategies, such as providing ongoing monitoring
and feedback to those delivering the intervention, provide
a more explicit acknowledgement of the importance of
quality of delivery and its potential moderating effect on
implementation fidelity [28,29].
A study of the implementation of a parent training pro-
gramme included quality of teaching in its Fidelity of
Implementation Rating System (FIMP) [8]. This involved
assessments by trained observers to determine whether
the parent trainers applied both verbal and active teaching
strategies, as required by the intervention. The scale stipu-
lated that an "Over-reliance on verbal teaching can result
in lower scores". Trained observers were also used to
assess both content and process fidelity, including quality
of delivery, of a life skills training program delivered by
teachers in the United States [19]. However, these studies
did not analyse quality of delivery as a moderator of
implementation fidelity, but rather as a discrete aspect of
fidelity.
Participant responsiveness
If participants view an intervention as being of no rele-
vance to them, then their non-engagement may be a
major cause of its failure or low coverage, and thus imple-
mentation fidelity may be low. This idea – that the uptake
of a new intervention depends on its acceptance by and
acceptability to those receiving it – echoes Rogers' diffu-
sion of innovations theory [30]. Participant responsive-
ness may therefore be an important moderator in any
process examining implementation fidelity. For example,
it has been found that implementation fidelity of pre-
scribed drug interventions for elderly people in the com-
munity can be low because these patients deliberately fail
to comply with their prescribed regimens [31-33]. Rea-
sons for this intentional non-compliance include the
unpleasant side effects of the drugs, and because the ther-
apy is only preventative or symptoms only mild, so
patients feel less inclined to comply [31-33]. In a study of
a school-based health promotion intervention, the teach-
ers reported that they did not implement certain compo-
Implementation Science  2007, 2:40 http://www.implementation science.com/content/2/1/40
Page 7 of 9
(page number not for citation purposes)nents of the intervention if they felt the students were not
responding and were not interested [34].
In fact, participants covered by this moderator of imple-
mentation fidelity encompass not only the individuals
receiving the intervention, but also those responsible for
it. For example, studies examining factors associated with
substance abuse prevention and health promotion pro-
grammes in schools found that teachers' beliefs concern-
ing the intervention itself, for example whether they liked
it or not, and the training and support they themselves
had received, were all associated with their level of adher-
ence to the intervention [34,35]. In other words, higher
levels of implementation fidelity were achieved when
those responsible for delivering an intervention were
enthusiastic about it. The organisation more broadly may
also influence the response of those delivering a new
intervention. If an organisation, as represented by senior
management for example, is not committed to an inter-
vention, then the responsiveness of individuals may be
affected, too [2]. This is a key aspect of all organisational
change literature [36].
Self-report is the most common means of evaluating the
responsiveness of all participants to an intervention [30-
34,37]. This assessment can involve several perspectives. It
may evaluate how far participants fully accept the respon-
sibilities required by an intervention [38], how far they
perceive the intervention to be useful [26] and, more
broadly, how responsive the environment is into which
an intervention is introduced, the so-called "therapeutic
milieu", which may not be conducive to a favourable
response from participants [21]. In studies that have
examined these dimensions of participant responsiveness,
participants used logs and calendars to record and report
on their response to the intervention being implemented.
Participant responsiveness may even reach beyond atti-
tudes to actual action, for example, to gauge whether a
"treatment has been . . . understood . . . and that the indi-
vidual performs treatment related . . . . skills and strate-
gies" [29]. In this sense, "enactment" may be considered a
potential element of participant responsiveness [25].
Relationships be tween moderators
These moderators are not necessarily discrete elements.
There may be relationships at work between two or more
moderators. An obvious example is where the provision
of training and guidelines on how to deliver an interven-
tion may have a direct impact on the quality with which
an intervention is actually delivered (and this may in turn
affect the fidelity with which an intervention is imple-
mented). If the amount of training provided is small, then
the quality of the resulting delivery may be poor. Facilita-
tion strategies may also influence participant responsive-
ness: The provision of incentives could make bothproviders and participants more amenable or responsive
to a new intervention. Quality of delivery may function in
the same way: a well-delivered intervention may make
participants more enthusiastic and committed to it. One
moderator might therefore predict another.
However, as noted above, these relationships are more
complex than may be captured in the simple correlation
of large numbers of facilitation strategies producing high
quality of delivery, or by stating that small incentives pro-
duce limited participant responsiveness. One reason is the
moderating role of intervention complexity: A simple
intervention may not require much training or guidance
to achieve high quality of delivery or participant respon-
siveness. A small amount of training may suffice. In other
words, there may be interaction effects between modera-
tors, i.e., when the effect of one factor is dependent on the
level of another. Participants may also be enthusiastic
about new interventions because of other factors, regard-
less of incentives or other strategies.
Thus the interaction of these moderators may further
affect the relationship between an intervention and the
fidelity with which it is implemented.
Measurement
The implication of our framework is that any evaluation
must measure all the factors listed above that influence
the degree of implementation fidelity, such as interven-
tion complexity and the adequacy of facilitation strate-
gies. It also needs to gauge participant responsiveness or
receptiveness to proposed and implemented interven-
tions. With the exception of a few studies that do measure
quality of delivery or participant responsiveness
[8,20,38], most implementation fidelity research focuses
solely on a fidelity score determined almost exclusively by
adherence [3,6-8,21,22,27-29,38,39]. Moreover, this
research rarely reports high implementation fidelity
[8,29,40]. It actually often falls short of the ideal and is
sometimes even very poor, yet it is only by measuring the
moderators described above that potential explanations
for low or inadequate implementation may be appre-
hended or understood. It is only by identifying and con-
trolling for the contribution of possible barriers to
implementation that such issues can be addressed and
higher implementation achieved.
Summary
Achievement of high implementation fidelity is one of the
best ways of replicating the success with interventions
achieved by original research. Successful evidence-based
practice is governed by many things [41], and implemen-
tation fidelity is one of them. This paper offers a more
complete conceptual framework for implementation
fidelity than proposed hitherto, and explains why and
Implementation Science  2007, 2:40 http://www.implementation science.com/content/2/1/40
Page 8 of 9
(page number not for citation purposes)how implementation fidelity should be evaluated. The
framework is multifaceted, encompassing both the inter-
vention and its delivery. Adherence relates to the content
and dose of the intervention, i.e., has the content of the
intervention – its 'active ingredients' – been received by
the participants as often and for as long as it should have
been. However, the degree to which full adherence, i.e.,
high implementation fidelity, is achieved may be moder-
ated by factors affecting the delivery process, such as facil-
itation strategies, quality of delivery, and participant
responsiveness.
This conceptualisation provides researchers with a poten-
tial framework for implementation research. Monitoring
of implementation fidelity following this framework ena-
bles better evaluation of the actual impact of an interven-
tion on outcomes. In turn, the credibility and utility of the
resulting research would be enhanced accordingly. It also
offers evidence-based practitioners a guide to the proc-
esses and factors at play when implementing interven-
tions described in research. However, much more research
is needed on this topic. Empirical research is needed to
test the framework itself and to clarify the moderating
impact of the components included here.
