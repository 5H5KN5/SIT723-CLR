Objective: Most American adults fail to achieve recommended levels of physical activity and, as a result,
are at elevated risk for many chronic diseases. Affective processes have been validated as targets for
increasing physical activity but are rarely targeted directly by behavioral interventions. This article
describes 2 early phase studies used to develop HeartPhone, a smartphone application for conditioning
associations between physical activity and pleasure. HeartPhone exposes users to brief doses of evalu-
ative conditioning stimuli via background images on a smartphone lock screen. Method: Study 1
evaluated the feasibility of delivering mobile evaluative conditioning and estimated doses received over
7–21 days in a small sample of users ( n/H110056). Study 2 used a single-group prepost design to evaluate user
experience and determine whether any change in reflective motivation or physical activity was possible
over 8 weeks of HeartPhone use ( n/H1100519). Results: In Study 1, users accumulated almost 2 min/day of
exposure to conditioning stimuli, indicating the feasibility of delivering microdoses of evaluative
conditioning via smartphone lock screens. In Study 2, adults reported accepting the application and
conditioning stimuli, improved affective judgments of physical activity (enjoyment, intrinsic motivation,
integrated regulations), and increased physical activity. Conclusions: These results provide proof-of-
concept for a low-friction approach for enhancing affective processing and increasing physical activity.
Based on early phase success as a tool for engaging smartphone users in behavior change, the HeartPhone
intervention is ready for a Phase IIb pilot and III efficacy trials.

Physical activity is an important health behavior across the life
span. People who engage in regular physical activity live longer
and have better physical and mental health than those who do not
engage in regular physical activity ( Physical Activity Guidelines
Advisory Committee, 2018 ). Unfortunately, few American adults
engage in regular physical activity ( Whitfield et al., 2019 ). Many
interventions have been developed to promote physical activity
and individual-level determinants have been targeted most often
(King et al., 2019 ). Until recently, it has been relatively uncommon
for interventions to directly target the affective processes that
regulate physical activity ( Williams, Rhodes, & Conner, 2019 ).
Even fewer have targeted automatic motivational processes that
can occur rapidly and can lie outside of conscious awareness. This
article reviews research that identified a novel affective target for
physical activity interventions—automatic affective evaluations—and presents early phase work developing a digital tool to promote
physical activity by altering automatic and reflective affective
processing of physical activity.
Automatic Affective Evaluations Are a Target for
Promoting Physical Activity
Social–cognitive and control theories have either explicitly or
implicitly guided most individual-level physical activity promo-
tion efforts ( Rhodes & Nigg, 2011 ). These theories posit that goals
are proximal determinants of behavior ( Bandura, 1997 ;Carver &
Scheier, 1998 ). One limitation of these approaches is that goals do
not always translate into action and people who intend to engage
in physical activity often fail to convert their intention into action
(Rhodes & Dickau, 2012 ). In those cases, people seem to default
to predictable, counterintentional behaviors without any effort or
awareness. Automatic processes have been proposed to account for
some of these failures to engage in intended physical activity, as
well as for some occasions when people accumulate unintended
physical activity.
Dual-process models that differentiate reflective and automatic
motivational processes regulating behavior—and health behavior
specifically—have gained considerable traction in recent years
(Deutsch & Strack, 2014 ;Evans, 2008 ;Hofmann, Friese, & Wiers,
2008 ;Sheeran, Gollwitzer, & Bargh, 2013 ;Smith & DeCoster,
2000 ). Reflective processes involve relatively more awareness,
intention, and effort. They draw on propositional reasoning which
slows their effects. Physical activity interventions that enhanceX

efficacy beliefs, set goals, or promote self-monitoring are targeting
reflective processes. In contrast, automatic processes involve rel-
atively less awareness, intention, and effort. They draw on learned
associations to inspire rapid action. A variety of automatic affec-
tive and cognitive processes exist and several have been linked
with physical activity ( Rebar et al., 2016 ). This article builds on
research that identified automatic affective evaluations (i.e., im-
plicit attitudes) as a novel target for physical activity interventions
(Conroy, Hyde, Doerksen, & Ribeiro, 2010 ).
Automatic affective evaluations represent “the affective experi-
ences that arise rapidly and involuntarily when the concept of
physical activity is activated” ( Conroy & Berry, 2017 , p. 230).
They are evaluative dispositions arising from the repetition of
affective experiences during physical activity. As affectively
charged experiences accumulate, physical activity becomes asso-
ciated with characteristic pleasant or unpleasant affective states.
Subsequently, when the concept of physical activity is activated,
activation spreads—rapidly and involuntarily—to associated
memories of affective experiences ( Anderson, 1983 ). The valence
of affective states associated with physical activity may evoke
subtle but almost immediate attentional biases and approach-
avoidance motivational tendencies that could increase or decrease
the likelihood of action ( Cheval, Sarrazin, Isoard-Gautheur, Radel,
& Friese, 2015 ). Even if affective memories do not rise above the
threshold of awareness that would immediately manifest in reflec-
tive affective judgments, they can provide a seed that is elaborated
into a reflective affective judgment with a bit of effort ( Gawronski
& Bodenhausen, 2006 ). For example, a person who experiences a
pleasant automatic affective evaluation of physical activity could
reflect on that gut feeling and decide that it is because he or she
enjoys physical activity. Affective judgments are not affective
experiences but instead represent “judgments about the overall
pleasure/displeasure, enjoyment, and feeling states expected from
enacting physical activity” ( Rhodes, Fiala, & Conner, 2009 ,p .
181). On average, automatic affective evaluations of physical
activity appear to be largely independent of reflective affective
judgments about physical activity but automatic affective evalua-
tions can be elaborated into reflective affective judgments as well
(Conroy & Berry, 2017 ;Hyde, Doerksen, Ribeiro, & Conroy,
2010 ). Thus, automatic affective evaluations could have both
direct and indirect influences on physical activity.
A recent meta-analysis of 55 effect sizes from 26 observational
studies conducted with adult (primarily student) samples in North
American and European laboratories revealed a small positive
association between automatic affective evaluations and physical
activity ( Chevance, Bernard, Chamberland, & Rebar, 2019 ). This
evidence was drawn from observational designs and does not
permit strong causal inferences about the effects of automatic
affective evaluations on physical activity. Experimental manipu-
lations of automatic affective evaluations are needed to add
rigor to this literature. Meta-analyses of observational and
experimental studies also revealed medium and small-to-
medium effect sizes, respectively, linking reflective affective
judgments with physical activity ( Rhodes et al., 2009 ;Rhodes,
Gray, & Husband, 2019 ). Interventions that modify affective
processing can influence physical activity through both auto-
matic and reflective mechanisms.Modifying Affective Processing and Promoting
Physical Activity
Evaluative conditioning is an established behavior change tech-
nique used to promote associative learning. This technique condi-
tions new associations via the repeated pairing of a target (i.e.,
conditioned stimulus) with a desired attribute (i.e., valenced un-
conditioned stimulus; De Houwer, Thomas, & Baeyens, 2001 ).
The conditioned and unconditioned stimuli can be presented se-
quentially or simultaneously. Effects do not differ as a function of
forward, backward or simultaneous presentation ( Hofmann, De
Houwer, Perugini, Baeyens, & Crombez, 2010 ). This technique
has consistently proven effective for increasing reflective affective
judgments, such as liking, of the conditioned stimulus ( De Houwer
et al., 2001 ;Forscher et al., 2019 ;Hofmann et al., 2010 ;Lai et al.,
2014 ). In fact, effects are significantly larger for explicit than
implicit measures of affective processing ( Hofmann et al., 2010 ).
Associative learning processes have been widely targeted in
marketing and politics to manipulate consumer behavior and votes
(Schachtman, Walker, & Fowler, 2011 ;Westen, 2007 ). For exam-
ple, one of the most devastating health-related applications came
from Big Tobacco. In 1924, Marlboro cigarettes—one of the first
filtered cigarettes—were marketed as a “mild as May” ladies’
cigarette. In the early 1950s, researchers in the U.S. and United
Kingdom reported links between smoking, cancer, and mortality
(Doll & Hill, 2004 ;Wynder & Graham, 1950 ). By 1954, Phillip
Morris sensed an opportunity to market their filtered cigarettes to
men by changing packaging and marketing strategy. They com-
missioned the famous Chicago advertiser, Leo Burnett, to rebrand
their product. To make filtered cigarettes seem more masculine, he
created the Marlboro man—a handsome cowboy smoking, some-
times on horseback, in what came to be known as Marlboro
Country ( “The Marlboro Man,” n.d. ). This ad campaign created a
new association between Marlboro cigarettes and a masculine
archetype that appealed to frontier values. The Marlboro Man was
launched nationally in 1955 and, within a year, Marlboro went
from 1% market share to being the fourth leading brand with $5
billion sales (3,241% revenue increase). Despite growing popular
attention to the health risks associated with smoking, by 1957
Marlboro sales were up to $20 billion annually. By 1971, smoking
commercials were banned but the Marlboro Man had become an
iconic presence in print ads. Marlboro was the #1 brand worldwide
within a year. When the tobacco industry diversified their holdings
in the 1980s, they applied this same conditioning technique to
market sugar-sweetened beverages to children (e.g., Kool Aid;
Nguyen, Glantz, Palmer, & Schmidt, 2019 ).
Associative learning via evaluative conditioning is not the ex-
clusive purview of profit-motivated industries and can be har-
nessed to promote health-enhancing behaviors as well. It has been
applied in laboratory settings to improve healthy eating, reduce
alcohol use, and even improve relationship satisfaction ( Bui &
Fazio, 2016 ;Hollands, Prestwich, & Marteau, 2011 ;Houben,
Schoenmakers, & Wiers, 2010 ;McNulty, Olson, Jones, & Acosta,
2017 ;Walsh & Kiviniemi, 2014 ). Three attempts to condition
more pleasant automatic affective evaluations of physical activity
have yielded mixed results. A 3-min audio-recorded imagery script
altered automatic affective evaluations of physical activity ( Mark-
land, Hall, Duncan, & Simatovic, 2015 ). In another study, a single
computer-based evaluative conditioning activity with 120 trialsThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

(60 involving physical activity as the conditioned stimulus) in-
creased automatic affective evaluations of physical activity ( An-
toniewicz & Brand, 2016 ). Participants with negative automatic
associations who were assigned to receive evaluative conditioning
to create more positive associations selected more intense activity
on a subsequent cycle ergometer task. A third trial installed posters
in hospital rooms for 4 days as conditioning stimuli. The posters
combined an image of physical activity with a printed affectively
pleasant adjective. Although the posters were displayed for 4 days,
participants’ exposure to those images could not be quantified and
there was no change in automatic affective evaluations or
accelerometer-measured physical activity ( Chevance, Berry, Boi-
ché, & Heraud, 2019 ).
These evaluative conditioning interventions to promote physical
activity have been limited to relatively controlled environments.
Three different modalities have been used to deliver the condition-
ing interventions (imagery, computer task, posters) but none lend
themselves to widespread dissemination and implementation in the
field. These limitations can be addressed by developing an evalu-
ative conditioning intervention that could be implemented on
smartphones.
A Digital Tool for Evaluative Conditioning
The HeartPhone application is a new digital tool for mobile
evaluative conditioning. The smartphone provides a flexible means
for exposing users to conditioning stimuli in the natural context of
their daily lives. Mobile health applications are vulnerable to fail
if users do not open the application and engage with the behavior
change technique(s) regularly (e.g., Laing et al., 2014 ). The Heart-
Phone application circumvents this barrier to engagement by pre-
senting conditioning stimuli via background wallpaper graphics on
the lock screen every time a smartphone is activated. Human-
computer interaction studies indicate that people typically activate
their smartphones an average of 40 times/day ( Harbach, De Luca,
& Egelman, 2016 ;Harbach, De Luca, Malkin, & Egelman, 2016 ).
Thus, HeartPhone users are expected to be exposed (briefly) to an
average of 40 conditioning stimuli per day.
Purpose
Guided by the obesity-related behavioral intervention trials
(ORBIT) model ( Czajkowski et al., 2015 ), two studies were con-
ducted to establish proof-of-concept for the HeartPhone interven-
tion. Modeled on the drug development pipeline, the ORBIT
model outlines an iterative phased approach for translating basic
discoveries (e.g., that affective processes predict physical activity)
into behavioral interventions (e.g., HeartPhone). The work pre-
sented here represents Phase I (Design) and Phase II (Preliminary
Testing) of the ORBIT model. Study 1 evaluated the technical
feasibility of changing lock screen wallpaper with every screen
activation and measuring the duration of each exposure to condi-
tioning stimuli (i.e., duration the background wallpaper was pre-
sented on the screen). Study 2 evaluated the effects of HeartPhone
exposure on reflective affective judgments and self-reported phys-
ical activity to establish whether there was a clinically meaningful
signal of intervention effects.Study 1
HeartPhone v1.0 was designed to present a collage of four
stimuli involving two images of physical activity (conditioned
stimuli) and two affectively pleasant images (unconditioned stim-
uli) every time participants activated their smartphone. Stimulus
collages varied randomly across trials to reduce boredom.
Exposure to the evaluative conditioning stimuli requires that
participants look at their screen when unlocking the phone. Screen
activation by itself proved to be an insufficient measure of expo-
sure because notifications from apps or incoming messages can
activate screens automatically and may not elicit attention in the
way voluntary unlocking actions do. Thus, exposure time was
measured as the duration required to successfully unlock the
smartphone. This metric may underestimate exposure time because
participants could turn on their phones, look at the screen, and be
exposed to evaluative conditioning stimuli without fully unlocking
the smartphone. Indeed, it is known that people who do not wear
watches activate their phone screens more frequently than people
with watches ( Harbach et al., 2016 ).
Method
Participants and procedure. Six adults with smartphones
that used an Android operating system were recruited via fliers in
community locations to install HeartPhone v1.0 for 7 ( n/H110052), 14
(n/H110052), or 21 days ( n/H110052). Participants provided written informed
consent and procedures were approved by the Institutional Review
Board. With every screen activation, the app presented a randomly
selected lock screen background wallpaper.
Measures. The HeartPhone v1.0 app recorded all screen ac-
tivations and the duration of exposure to each image presented
(i.e., time from a smartphone screen turning on until the lock
screen pattern password was entered successfully) and transmitted
results to a backend server.
Results and Discussion
This sample was women (67%), not Hispanic or Latino (83%),
White (83%), capable of performing unassisted physical activity
(100%), employed full-time (83%), not married (67%), and with-
out children (67%). The average age was 34.3 years ( SD/H110058.5;
range/H1100525 – 49). Few participants were members of a walking/
exercise/physical activity club (17%) or used an activity tracker
regularly (17%). None used smartphone apps to motivate them-
selves to exercise regularly (0%).
Participants screens were activated on 4,973 occasions over 84
person days. Of those activations, 2,466 involved the user unlock-
ing the phone (either after a notification or spontaneously) and
2,327 involved the screen being activated without involvement of
unlocking behavior (e.g., due to an incoming notification or mes-
sage). Daily unlocking frequencies ranged from three to 76 times/
day ( M/H1100528.0, SD/H1100517.6, Mdn/H1100525.5, interquartile range /H11005
13.0–40.8). The median daily exposure time during successful
unlocking events was 116.75 s (interquartile range /H1100561.6–220.0
s). Screen activation frequencies without unlocking ranged from
one to 94 times/day ( M/H1100526.4, SD/H1100524.8, Mdn/H1100516). It was not
clear that participants were exposed to stimuli during these auto-
matic screen activations so daily exposure time was not calculated.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

These results confirm that participants activated smartphones
frequently throughout the day. The average number of activations
was lower than previous estimates from field studies of unlocking
behavior ( Harbach et al., 2016 ;Harbach, von Zezschwitz, Ficht-
ner, Luca, & Smith, 2014 ). This difference may be attributed to the
requirement that participants use the pattern-to-unlock lock screen.
This format creates more friction than other unlocking methods
and could dissuade participants from opening their phone as fre-
quently as they might without that friction. It may also be conser-
vative because it does not include exposures that did not lead to
unlocking (e.g., reading notifications, checking the time). Notwith-
standing this difference, participants were exposed to evaluative
conditioning stimuli for approximately 2 min/day. Based on this
estimate, cumulative exposure time should rapidly exceed that of
laboratory-based evaluative conditioning procedures. These find-
ings led to the conclusion that delivering mobile evaluative con-
ditioning via background wallpaper on a lock screen is technically
feasible.
Study 2
The second step in the intervention development process in-
volved evaluating the effects of HeartPhone exposure on reflective
affective judgments and self-reported physical activity to establish
whether there was a clinically meaningful signal of intervention
effects. Based on Study 1, the app was refined to reduce friction by
presenting evaluative conditioning stimuli on a slide-to-unlock
lock screen ( Van Bruggen et al., 2013 ). HeartPhone v1.1 simply
involves swiping the image after activating their phone instead of
entering a pattern as with HeartPhone v1.0. Each collage was also
refined to include a single pair of images that activated the concept
of physical activity (conditioned stimulus) and evoked pleasure
(unconditioned stimulus). Figure 1 presents an illustrative image of
a conditioning stimulus.
Method
Participants and procedure. Adults ( n/H1100519) using smart-
phones with an Android operating system were recruited via fliers
placed in the community. Procedures were approved by the Insti-
tutional Review Board. Participants provided written informed
consent and completed questionnaires about their demographic
characteristics, motivation, and physical activity during a baseline
lab visit. The researchers assisted participants in installing the
HeartPhone v1.1 app on their Android device. At the end of each
week, participants were prompted via e-mail to complete an online
questionnaire about their past-week physical activity. After 8
weeks, participants returned to the lab to complete questionnaires
and remove the app from their smartphone.
Measures. The HeartPhone v1.1 app recorded all screen ac-
tivations and the duration of exposure to each image presentation
and transmitted results to a backend server.
Participants reported on past-week physical activity every week
using a web-based short-form of the International Physical Activ-
ity Questionnaire ( Booth, 2000 ;Craig et al., 2003 ;Sjöström et al.,
2005 ). For walking, moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity ac-
tivity, participants reported the number of days when they engaged
in that activity over the past week and the average daily duration
of activity at that intensity on those days. Established scoringcriteria were used to generate scores for total physical activity
volume and to classify participants as low ( /H11021600 metabolic equiv-
alent [MET] ●minutes/week), moderate (600–2,999 MET ●min-
utes/week), or high ( /H113503,000 MET ●minutes/week) active
(Sjöström et al., 2002 ).

During the baseline and Week 8 lab visits, participants described
their motivation and reflective affective judgments about physical
activity using seven questionnaires with established psychometric
properties. A four-item scale from the Self-Report Habit Index was
used to measure behavioral automaticity ( Gardner, Abraham,
Lally, & de Bruijn, 2012 ;Verplanken & Melkevik, 2008 ;Verplan-
ken & Orbell, 2003 ). Items were rated from 1 ( strongly disagree )
t o7( strongly agree ) and responses were averaged to create a scale
score. The 18-item Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale was used to
assess affective judgments of enjoyment for physical activities
over the past 4 weeks ( Kendzierski & DeCarlo, 1991 ). The original
items on this scale were bipolar and were reformatted for clarity
using the anchor on the left side of the original scale as the item
stem (e.g., “I enjoy it” to “I hate it” simply became “I enjoy it”).
Items were rated from 1 ( disagree a lot )t o5( agree a lot ).
Responses were reverse-scored as needed and averaged to create a
scale score. Two scales from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory
were completed to assess interest/enjoyment (seven items) and
value/usefulness (seven items; McAuley, Duncan, & Tammen,
1989 ). Items were rated from 1 ( not at all true for me )t o7( very
true for me ) and responses were averaged to create each scale
score. The 23-item extended Behavioral Regulations for Exercise
Questionnaire-2 was used to measure a range of intrinsic and
extrinsic behavioral regulations ( Markland & Tobin, 2004 ;Mul-
lan, Markland, & Ingledew, 1997 ;Wilson, Rodgers, Loitz, &
Scime, 2006 ). Items were rated from 0 ( not true for me )t o4( very
true for me ) and responses were averaged to create scale scores for
intrinsic motivation, integrated regulation, identified regulation,
introjected regulation, external regulation, and amotivation. Atti-
tudes toward physical activity were assessed using six bipolar
items each ( Rhodes, Blanchard, Matheson, & Coble, 2006 ). Af-
fective attitude item anchors were enjoyable/unenjoyable, pleas-
ant/unpleasant, and exciting/boring. Instrumental attitude item an-
chors were useful/useless, wise/unwise, and beneficial/harmful.
Each item was rated by dragging a slider between the two poles.
Responses were recorded on a 101-point scale ranging from 0 to
100 and averaged to create each scale score.
At the end of the study, participants also completed the 10-item
System Usability Scale ( Bangor, Miller, & Kortum, 2009 ;Lewis &
Sauro, 2009 ) and custom items about their experience with the
HeartPhone app. Items were rated from 1 ( strongly disagree )t o5
(strongly agree ) and responses were averaged to create scale
scores. Custom items included: “I found the pictures in the Heart-
Phone app to be interesting [enjoyable]” (rated from /H110022[strongly
disagree ]t o/H110012[strongly agree ]), “I would be more interested in
using the HeartPhone app if I could choose my own images” (rated
as yes/maybe/no), “How useful did you find the HeartPhone app?”
(rated from 0 [ not at all useful ]t o4[ extremely useful ]), “Would
you keep the HeartPhone app on your telephone if that was
possible?” (rated as yes/maybe/no), “Did the HeartPhone app slow
the processing speed of your phone?” (rated as yes/maybe/no),
“Did you ever tell your friends or family about the HeartPhone
app?” (rated as yes/maybe/no), “Would you recommend the Heart-
Phone app to your friends or family?” (rated as yes/maybe/no), “I
would use the HeartPhone app if it was free” (rated as yes/maybe/
no), “Using the HeartPhone app reminded me to exercise” (rated as
yes/maybe/no), “Using the HeartPhone app made exercise seem
more pleasant” (rated as yes/maybe/no), and “How useful did youfind the HeartPhone app?” (rated from 0 [ not at all useful ]t o4
[extremely useful ]).
Results and Discussion
Participants (53% male) were not Hispanic or Latino (100%),
White (79%), capable of performing unassisted physical activity
(100%), employed full-time (63%), not married (58%), and with-
out children (79%). The average age was 30.1 years ( SD/H110059.3;
range/H1100520–49). Few participants were members of a walking/
exercise/physical activity club (11%), used an activity tracker
regularly (16%), or used smartphone apps to motivate themselves
to exercise regularly (11%). One participant withdrew after 2
weeks but the remaining sample (95%) completed the entire pro-
tocol ( Mdn/H1100557 days).
A total of 50,243 unlock-triggered screen activations were re-
corded. On average, participants unlocked their smartphones 45.7
times/day ( SD/H1100532.3; range /H110057.3–107.0). Median presentation
time for stimuli during each unlocking cycle was 1.25 s (after
removing outliers in the top 5% of presentation times). Switching
from a pattern unlock (v1.0) to a slide-to-unlock (v1.1) lock screen
increased recorded screen activations but decreased average expo-
sure time for each unlocking episode.
With respect to system usability, the app was rated in the
good-to-excellent range ( M/H110054.2/5, SD/H110050.6). Images were rated
as moderately interesting ( M/H110053.8/5, SD/H110051.4) and enjoyable
(M/H110053.7/5, SD/H110051.3). The majority (77%) of participants agreed
or strongly agreed that the images were interesting and enjoyable.
Only 29% expressed that they would be more likely to use the app
if it included their own images.
Most participants would consider using the app if it was free
(88%), were interested in keeping the app on their phones (77%),
had told friends or family about the app (82%), and would recom-
mend the app to friends or family (77%). A minority (12%)
believed that the app slowed the processor on their phone. Finally,
participants reported that the app reminded them to exercise (77%)
and made exercise seem more pleasant (65%). Overall, most
participants (88%) rated the app as being moderately useful or
better and only a minority (12%) rated it as not useful.
Table 1 summarizes descriptive statistics and internal consis-
tency estimates for each motivation scale. Three scales represent-
ing less autonomous behavioral regulations for physical activity
had unacceptable internal consistency estimates (i.e., /H9251/H11021 .70) on
one occasion. As shown in the table, statistically significant in-
creases were observed for ratings of enjoyment, affective attitudes,
overall attitudes, value/usefulness, intrinsic motivation, and inte-
grated regulations. Although not statistically significant, trends
(i.e., d/H113500.30) were observed for more favorable instrumental
attitudes, greater interest/enjoyment, increased identified regula-
tions, and stronger habit strength (behavioral automaticity).
Observed changes in affective judgments and autonomous mo-
tivation were consistent with downstream effects of evaluative
conditioning predicted by the associative-propositional model
(Gawronski & Bodenhausen, 2006 ) and emerging dual-process
models of physical activity (e.g., Brand & Ekkekakis, 2018 ;Che-
val et al., 2018 ;Conroy & Berry, 2017 ). Affective judgments, such
as enjoyment, have consistently demonstrated medium-sized pos-
itive associations with physical activity ( Rhodes et al., 2009 ,
2019 ). Likewise, more autonomous behavioral regulations, such asThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

intrinsic motivation and identified regulations, have been linked
with greater physical activity ( Teixeira, Carraça, Markland, Silva,
& Ryan, 2012 ). These changes are consistent with the pattern of
reflective elaboration that one would expect if the app enhanced
automatic affective evaluations but do not demonstrate that Heart-
Phone modified automatic affective evaluations. Future research
should investigate whether the HeartPhone intervention is effec-
tive for modifying this target of behavior change and compare the
contributions of automatic and relative affective processing mech-
anisms to behavior change.
The dataset had 16 participants with complete weekly physical
activity data (one participant failed to complete the baseline mea-
sure and another failed to complete the final measure). Most (82%)
showed positive trends in their weekly self-reported physical ac-
tivity volume. Prepost change was statistically significant, t(15)/H11005
2.27, p/H11021.05,d/H110050.75. Figure 2 indicates a monotonic trend forincreasing weekly physical activity across the eight assessments
during the intervention. We conducted a sensitivity analysis using
the first and last valid scores from each participant, and prepost
change remained statistically significant, t(17)/H110052.61, p/H11021.05,
d/H110050.64. Participants classified as low active at baseline increased
to moderately active (75%) or highly active (25%) at 8 weeks;
none remained low active. Participants classified as moderately
active at baseline increased to highly active (80%) or remained
moderately active (20%) at 8 weeks. Participants classified as
highly active at baseline remained highly active (88%) or de-
creased to moderately active (12%) at 8 weeks.
Overall, the observed changes in physical activity in this study
were more than three times larger than the average effect of
physical activity interventions with healthy adults ( Conn, Hafdahl,
& Mehr, 2011 ). As provocative as this finding appears to be,
caution is warranted pending replication with a larger sample using
a randomized controlled trial design and device-based measures of
physical activity.
General Discussion
This early phase intervention development research translated
basic findings that validated a new target for increasing physical
activity into a digital tool for enhancing affective processing and
promoting physical activity. Findings indicated that delivering
evaluative conditioning on a temporally-distributed schedule via
background graphics on lock screens is both feasible and accept-
able to participants with Android smartphones. As expected, re-
flective affective processes and physical activity increased with
cumulative exposure to these conditioning stimuli. Conclusions
about intervention efficacy are premature because of the small
sample size and absence of a rigorous experimental design with an
appropriate comparator. Nevertheless, these findings provide
proof-of-concept for temporally distributed evaluative condition-
ing via smartphone lock screens.
The first contribution of this work involved demonstrating that
microdoses of evaluative conditioning can be delivered via smart-Table 1

phone lock screens. Lock screen use has typically been studied in
the context of security and risk aversion ( Egelman et al., 2014 ;
Harbach et al., 2016 ;Harbach, De Luca, Malkin, et al., 2016 ;
Harbach et al., 2014 ;Van Bruggen et al., 2013 ). Others have
placed widgets on lock screens to engage users with a health
behavior intervention that involves self-tracking ( Choe et al.,
2017 ). To the best of our knowledge, the HeartPhone app is the
first to capitalize on this digital storefront to deliver a health
behavior intervention without imposing burden or creating friction
for users.
Approximately 65% of smartphone owners use a lock screen to
secure their smartphone ( Harbach, De Luca, Malkin, et al., 2016 ;
Van Bruggen et al., 2013 ). These screens are activated frequently
and, although each exposure is relatively brief, cumulative expo-
sure time will rapidly exceed what can be achieved in laboratory
evaluative conditioning protocols. Thus, HeartPhone may solve a
long-standing problem for how to deliver evaluative conditioning
interventions in the field. This strategy reduces friction by inte-
grating exposures in users’ existing workflows with their smart-
phones.
One limitation of this approach is that it can be difficult to
persuade users to use lock screens if they do not already use them
(Van Bruggen et al., 2013 ). Potential intervention reach was in-
creased in HeartPhone v1.1 by refining the app so users could use
a slide-to-unlock method instead of a pattern-to-unlock method.
Additionally, the type of lock screen used can influence the dura-
tion of exposure to conditioning stimuli. Specifically, pattern and
passcode methods take longer than the slide-to-unlock method
(Harbach et al., 2016 ). Tradeoffs exist. Pattern users initiate their
patterns quicker and enter them more quickly when successful.
Pattern users also make more errors and repeat their patterns more
frequently. Future research should investigate the impact of dif-
ferent lock screen methods on exposure time, affective processing,
and behavior change.
A second contribution of this work was in providing proof-of-
concept for smartphone-based delivery of evaluative conditioning in
the natural context of daily life. Evaluative conditioning is well-
established as a technique for modifying affective processing and
behavior in the laboratory ( De Houwer et al., 2001 ;Forscher et al.,
2019;Hofmann et al., 2010 ;Lai et al., 2014 ). Physical activity
researchers have examined environmental modifications to facilitate
evaluative conditioning ( Antoniewicz & Brand, 2016 ;Chevance,
Berry, et al., 2019 ). The present study extended prior work by imple-
menting a method to deliver evaluative conditioning via the digital
environment of smartphone lock screens. This implementation re-
quires the temporal distribution of exposures (unlike most laboratory
studies). Some evidence suggests that distributed exposures enhances
conditioning effects so this spaced implementation may be preferable
to massed conditioning protocols in the lab ( Richter & Gast, 2017 ). It
is also possible that cumulative exposure time from this approach is
overestimated if users do not visually orient to their screens immedi-
ately upon activation.
This application of evaluative conditioning sought to create or
strengthen associations between physical activity and pleasure. If
this approach increases physical activity—and light-intensity
physical activity in particular—it is possible that it could also
reduce sedentary behavior, either by displacing sedentary time or
offsetting the reward value of energy conservation (cf. Cheval et
al., 2018 ). Future work should consider sedentary time as a po-tential secondary outcome when evaluating HeartPhone. It may be
possible to reduce sedentary behavior by creating or strengthening
associations with displeasure directly; however, the images used to
activate displeasure in conditioning stimuli are unlikely to be
well-accepted by users. For example, the most unpleasant images
in the International Affective Picture System involve themes such
as contamination, mutilation, and threat ( Bradley & Lang, 2007 ).
It is difficult to conceive that users would tolerate seeing those
images upon every screen activation, especially when others in
their vicinity might also see the images. Thus, we expect that
mobile evaluative conditioning may be best suited to appetitive
rather than aversive conditioning of target behaviors.
Evaluative conditioning is a classical conditioning technique
that aims to strengthen associations between a conditioned and
unconditioned stimulus (as opposed to a stimulus and a behavioral
response). Health psychologists have long been interested in au-
tomatic processes that support health behaviors but much of this
work has focused on operant conditioning processes ( Hunt, Mat-
arazzo, Weiss, & Gentry, 1979 ). Observed changes in motivation
and behavior during HeartPhone use were consistent with expec-
tations from the associative-propositional evaluation model
(Gawronski & Bodenhausen, 2014 ); however, other mechanisms
of behavior change may also be engaged. For example, repeated
exposure to images that activate the concept of physical activity
may breed familiarity and increase liking (i.e., the mere exposure
hypothesis; Zajonc, 2001 ). Alternately, conditioning stimuli that
evoke pleasure could engage thought-action repertoires involving
playful or exploratory behavior (e.g., broaden-and-build theory;
Fredrickson, 2004 ). As research moves through the ORBIT pipe-
line from Phase II (preliminary testing) to Phase III (efficacy)
trials, it will be important both to evaluate both the efficacy of the
intervention and to determine the mechanism(s) of effects. In other
contexts, evaluative conditioning effects have shown resistance to
extinction ( Baeyens, Crombez, Van den Bergh, & Eelen, 1988 ;
Forscher et al., 2019 ;Gawronski, Gast, & De Houwer, 2015 ;Pine,
Mendelsohn, & Dudai, 2014 ;Vansteenwegen, Francken, Vervliet,
De Clercq, & Eelen, 2006 ). It will be important to investigate
whether this technique can address the persistent challenge of
behavioral maintenance ( Rothman, Sheeran, & Wood, 2009 ).
Questions about stimulus optimization, optimal dosing, and char-
acteristics of responders and nonresponders will also require at-
tention.
In the spirit of “failing fast,” the studies reported here used small
sample sizes and were not recruited to be representative of the
more diverse general population. Motivational and behavioral out-
comes were self-reported so changes may be due to demand
characteristics or testing threats. The single-group design also
makes it impossible to distinguish change from maturation so
causal inferences about efficacy are not possible. Notwithstanding
these limitations, the results clearly provide the proof-of-concept
that warrants progression to the next phase of intervention devel-
opment with more rigorous evaluations of effects on behavior,
biomedical risk factors and clinical outcomes.
In sum, the HeartPhone intervention was developed to promote
physical activity by engaging affective processing in a low-friction
manner. It provides a potential solution to the challenge of deliv-
ering evaluative conditioning interventions outside of laboratory
settings. The early phase studies reported here informed the design
and preliminary testing of the intervention. Results justify addi-This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

tional investment in Phase IIb/III development with pilots and
efficacy trials that incorporate more rigorous research designs,
more diverse samples, device-based behavioral outcome measures,
and biomedical risk factors as distal outcomes. If successful, the
HeartPhone intervention could also be adapted to intervene on
other affectively-regulated lifestyle behaviors that impact health
and well-being. This intervention approach could provide a much-
needed counterweight to commercial determinants of health that
target affective processing to advance industry interests. Thus, this
early phase intervention development work represents a beginning
of research—and is far from the final word—on the HeartPhone
intervention and its mobile evaluative conditioning method.
