Abstract 
Background Many people do not regularly participate in physical activity, which may negatively impact their health. 
Current physical activity guidelines are focused on promoting weekly accumulation of at least 150 min of moder -
ate to vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). Whilst revised guidance now recognises the importance of making 
small changes to physical activity behaviour, guidance still focuses on adults needing to achieve at least 150 min of 
MVPA per week. An alternative ‘whole day’ approach that could motivate the public to be more physically active, is 
a concept called Snacktivity™. Instead of focusing on achieving 150 min per week of physical activity, for example 
30 min of MVPA over 5 days, Snacktivity™ encourages the public to achieve this through small, but frequent, 2–5 min 
‘snacks’ of MVPA throughout the whole day.
Methods The primary aim is to undertake a feasibility trial with nested qualitative interviews to assess the feasibility 
and acceptability of the Snacktivity™ intervention to inform the design of a subsequent phase III randomised trial. A 
two-arm randomised controlled feasibility trial aiming to recruit 80 inactive adults will be conducted. Recruitment 
will be from health and community settings and social media. Participants will be individually randomised (1:1 ratio) 
to receive either the Snacktivity™ intervention or usual care. The intervention will last 12 weeks with assessment of 
outcomes completed before and after the intervention in all participants. We are interested in whether the Snacktiv-
ity™ trial is appealing to participants (assessed by the recruitment rate) and if the Snacktivity™ intervention and trial 
methods are acceptable to participants (assessed by Snacktivity™/physical activity adherence and retention rates). 
The intervention will be delivered by health care providers within health care consultations or by researchers. Partici-
pants’ experiences of the trial and intervention, and health care providers’ views of delivering the intervention within 
health consultations will be explored.

Background
Many people do not regularly participate in physical 
activity, which may adversely affect their health [1–3]. 
The prevention of non-communicable diseases is a major 
worldwide public health goal and improving lifestyle 
behaviours is considered essential to reducing the finan -
cial and health burden of non-communicable diseases 
[4]. Current physical activity guidelines are focused on 
weekly accumulation of at least 150 min of moderate to 
vigorous intensity physical activity per week (MVPA) 
[1]. This recommendation is often promoted as 30  min 
of MVPA on at least five days per week. Revised guid -
ance now also recognises the importance of making small 
changes to physical activity behaviour, and that any phys -
ical activity is better than none. However, guidance still 
focuses on the public needing to achieve a behavioural 
goal of at least 150  min of moderate intensity physical 
activity per week [1, 5, 6]. Guidance also advises that 
adults should complete muscle and strength based physi -
cal activity on at least two days per week, but very few 
adults (~ 20%) achieve this regularly [7]. The low levels 
of participation in physical activity in the population is 
concerning and there is no reason to assume the situa -
tion will improve unless acceptable and effective inter -
ventions are put in place. Guidelines themselves do not 
change behaviour, it is having the means and motivation 
to achieve them that matters for public health.
Snacktivity™
An alternative approach to physical activity promotion 
that could motivate the public to be more physically 
active throughout the whole day, is a concept referred to 
here as Snacktivity™ [8]. Rather than focusing on promot -
ing 150  min of physical activity per week (e.g. ~ 30  min 
per day over 5 days), Snacktivity™ focuses on encourag -
ing small, but frequent, doses of regular MVPA through -
out the whole day such that at least 150  min of MVPA 
is accumulated weekly. A physical activity ‘snack’ lasts 
between 2 to 5 min, and examples include walk-talk con -
versations, walking coffee breaks, using stairs instead of 
the lift, pacing whilst using the telephone, or parking the 
car a little further away and walking to the destination. 
Of relevance here, updated guidance from health agen -
cies around the world have removed the need for adults to complete physical activity in bouts lasting 10  min or 
more [1]. Improved cardio-metabolic aerobic fitness has 
been reported from brief bouts of physical activity [9–
13], with other studies reporting no difference in the rate 
of improvement in cardiovascular fitness between accu -
mulated and continuous bouts of physical activity lasting 
the same total duration [14].
How people feel about participation in physical activity 
is an important predictor of whether they will continue to 
engage and adhere with the activity [15]. A Snacktivity™ 
approach may help to develop individuals’ confidence 
to be physically active, particularly those who are inac -
tive, by encouraging people to ‘start small’ . Psychological 
theories recognise that achieving small changes is impor -
tant for developing task and self-regulatory self-efficacy, 
as well as habit formation [16, 17]. Simple actions may 
become habitual more quickly than complex ones, sug -
gesting that integration of small physical activity changes, 
or ‘snacks’ , within everyday routines may be more feasible 
than longer ones, for the population to initiate and then 
sustain [16]. Thus, over time Snacktivity™ may be a vehi -
cle for more sustained engagement in physical activity 
[8, 17]. Our earlier work has shown that the Snacktivity™ 
approach to promoting physical activity was viewed posi -
tively by the public [18, 19].
A common reason for inactivity is a perceived lack 
of time and Snacktivity™ provides an opportunity to 
address this barrier because it only requires a small 
amount of time, and no preparation/planning or equip -
ment is required [20]. Snacktivity™ can also be incorpo -
rated into usual daily routines (e.g. getting off the bus 
a stop early on the way to work and walking meetings), 
and may therefore be perceived as appealing and feasible 
to achieve, compared with aiming for larger changes in 
physical activity. Snacktivity™ also provides the opportu -
nity to promote the importance of muscle strength-based 
activities since many of these lend themselves to Snack -
tivity™ (e.g. squats when brushing your teeth and calf 
raises while waiting for the kettle to boil).
An inverse dose–response relationship exists between 
physical activity and all-cause mortality, therefore for 
people who are inactive any increase in physical activity 
is important [21, 22]. Snacktivity™ could also be impor -
tant because the relationship between physical activity 
and mortality is also characterised by a steep early slope 
Page 3 of 15
 Daley et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:45 
 
meaning the greatest gains in health are experienced 
when moving people who are inactive to 2–3 metabolic 
equivalent hours (MET/h) per week (~ 30 min per week), 
than moving more active people to doing marginally 
more [21–23]. In addition to concerns about low levels of 
participation in the population, there is growing concern 
about the amount of time the public spend in sedentary 
behaviours. Adults spend approximately 60–70% of their 
waking hours sedentary (e.g. sitting) [24]. This is of con -
cern because too much time spent sedentary has been 
associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease 
(CVD), all-cause and CVD-related mortality [25, 26], and 
guidelines now include recommendations about reducing 
time spent sedentary. An important additional benefit 
of Snacktivity™ is that it encourages breaking up sitting 
time throughout the day, meaning that it has the poten -
tial to impact two health behaviours simultaneously.
Aims and objectives
Whilst the idea that small bouts of physical activity 
may improve health is not new, it is not a message that 
has been highlighted to the public, in part, because of a 
lack of robust evidence in real world health settings. To 
date, no randomised controlled trial (RCT) has directly 
investigated whether Snacktivity™ increases participa -
tion in MVPA or the number of people meeting the rec -
ommended guidelines for physical activity. The primary 
aim of the Snacktivity™ research programme is to evalu -
ate the clinical and cost effectiveness of the Snacktivity™ 
intervention for increasing and maintaining physical 
activity by undertaking a large multicentre RCT. How -
ever, first we need to undertake a randomised feasibility 
trial with nested qualitative interviews to assess the fea -
sibility and acceptability of the Snacktivity™ intervention 
and the methods needed to conduct the phase III ran -
domised trial. We are seeking to test a complex interven -
tion and there are uncertainties, specifically regarding 
recruitment methods and rates, intervention adherence 
and participant retention, that need to be assessed before 
undertaking a large-scale RCT.
This feasibility trial aims to:
• Examine the recruitment rate to inform the planned 
phase III trial.
• Provide data to review and inform the sample size 
assumptions for the phase III trial.
• Assess the data collection methods, data complete -
ness and retention rates.
• Investigate the feasibility and acceptability of the 
Snacktivity™ intervention to the public and health 
care providers (HCPs) delivering the intervention.
• Assess adherence to the Snacktivity™ intervention• Gather data to refine the Snacktivity™ intervention 
and assess intervention delivery fidelity.
• Examine the potential for intervention contamina -
tion, to inform the decision to use individual ran -
domisation over a cluster RCT.
• Assess acceptability of the intervention training 
materials and procedures for HCPs.
Methods
Trial design and setting
A two-arm, multi-centre, individually randomised con -
trolled feasibility trial will be conducted with a target 
recruitment of 80 participants across the East and West 
Midlands, UK. See Fig.  1 for participant flow. Recruit -
ment will be from National Health Service (NHS), social 
care, public health, primary care services, community 
settings, and via social media. The trial will be con -
ducted in accordance with the United Kingdom (UK) 
Policy Framework for Health and Social Care Research, 
the applicable UK Statutory Instruments, (which include 
the Data Protection Act 2018) and the principles of Good 
Clinical Practice. The study is following protocol version 
7.0 (27 May 2022). Birmingham Community Healthcare 
NHS Foundation Trust in England are the sponsor for 
this trial. A SPIRIT Figure shows the different data col -
lection steps of the trial (Fig.  2) and a completed SPIRIT 
checklist is available as an additional file (Additional 
file 1).
Recruitment of participants
Participating general practices and NHS Trusts will 
search their electronic records to identify patients who 
are ≥ 18 years and have a health care consultation booked 
during the recruitment phase of the trial. These indi -
viduals will be sent a consultation appointment letter (or 
reminder of the upcoming appointment), along with the 
trial invitation letter, participant information sheet (PIS), 
expression of interest form (EOI) and the General Prac -
tice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ) for screen -
ing physical activity status [27]. Those classed as inactive/
moderately inactive/moderately active according to the 
GPPAQ (based on questions 1, 2a, and 2b) will be con -
tacted by telephone to complete eligibility screening with 
a member of the research team. If a general practice or 
NHS Trust service routinely uses, or wishes to use, Short 
Message Service text messages to send patients details 
of their scheduled appointments and/or to notify them 
about this study, a study invite link will be added to these 
text messages where the trial documents referred to 
above can be accessed by those interested in taking part.
Clinicians/HCPs can also raise the topic of the 
Snacktivity™ study in routine consultations and those

Fig. 2 SPIRIT figure
Page 6 of 15 Daley et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:45 
interested in discussing the trial further will be asked to 
complete the EOI form and GPPAQ, which will be passed 
on to the research team and these potential participants 
will complete eligibility screening with the research team 
by telephone. Potential participants can also be invited to 
take part in the study via community settings, including 
social media. These participants will either be sent the 
recruitment packs in the post or asked to complete the 
study documents electronically via the study invitation 
link as detailed above.
For all routes of recruitment, potentially eligible par -
ticipants will be contacted by telephone by a member of 
the research team to complete further and final eligibility 
screening (see below for the full list of criteria applied). If 
eligible, a baseline visit will be booked to collect assess -
ment data. For participants recruited via a reminder 
letter this will take place prior to participants’ health/
intervention consultation appointment.
Consent processes and steps
Potential participants will provide consent for all parts of 
the screening process described above, as well as consent 
to participate in the trial. Written informed consent for 
participation in the trial will be obtained for each partici -
pant by a researcher at the baseline visit. Where face to 
face visits are not possible, participants will be asked to 
provide written informed consent either online/email or 
by post. Participants will be made aware at the beginning 
of the study that they can freely withdraw (discontinue 
participation) from the trial (or part of) at any time with -
out giving a reason.
Participant eligibility
Inclusion
• Inactive, moderately inactive or moderately active (as 
measured by the GPPAQ) (27).
• Able to provide informed written consent.
• Aged ≥ 18 years.
• Own a mobile phone capable of hosting apps (Apple 
and Android).
• Agreement for their HCP to be notified of their 
involvement in the study (if applicable).
Exclusion criteria
• Unable to understand English sufficiently to com -
plete the trial assessments.
• Women known to be pregnant or breast feeding.Ineligible participants
If following screening an individual is not eligible, their 
identifiable data and contact details will be deleted from 
the trial system and any paper documents received from 
them will be destroyed. Verbal consent will be requested 
to store anonymous research data, for example, reasons 
why they were not eligible, to help inform any future trial.
Randomisation and blinding
Once eligibility is confirmed, consent obtained and 
baseline data collected, participants will be randomised 
at the level of the individual in a 1:1 ratio to either the 
Snacktivity™ intervention or usual care. We have cho -
sen individual rather than cluster randomisation for the 
definitive trial, and therefore also for this feasibility trial. 
An individually randomised trial also allows us to recruit 
participants outside a healthcare service/setting. Whilst 
there is a risk of contamination in an individually RCT, 
we anticipate the risk of contamination to be low and 
this will be assessed. Randomisation will be performed 
via a secure web-based service provided by the Birming -
ham Clinical Trials Unit. A minimisation algorithm will 
be used to ensure balance in the treatment allocation 
over the following variables: route of recruitment (pri -
mary care, community health service, other); age (18–
45, ≥ 46  years); and gender (male, female). A ‘random 
element’ will be included in the minimisation algorithm. 
Participants are not informed of their group allocation 
until all the baseline data has been collected.
Blinding
Participants will not be blinded to the exact purpose of 
the trial. It is not possible to blind the data collector, as 
the same researcher may be needed to undertake both 
the baseline and follow-up visit to collect data. We do not 
believe this will introduce bias, as the aim of this trial is 
to assess the feasibility of undertaking a large phase III 
RCT, and these outcomes are not affected by knowledge 
of group allocation and the data relating to the feasibility 
outcomes are not collected during the baseline and fol -
low up visits. Only secondary outcomes are collected by 
researcher. The trial treatment allocation will be posted 
directly to the participants HCPs (where applicable). 
Physical activity will be assessed using a blinded research 
grade wrist worn accelerometer in both groups.
The Snacktivity™ intervention
Participants randomised to the Snacktivity™ interven -
tion and the current guidance for physical activity pro -
vided at NHS, social care, primary care or public health 
consultations will be advised to accumulate their physi -
cal activity through Snacktivity™. Snacktivity™ is defined 
Page 7 of 15
 Daley et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:45 
 
as participation in small, but frequent, doses of regular 
MVPA throughout the day such that at least 150 min of 
MVPA is accumulated weekly. A physical activity ‘snack’ 
lasts between 2 to 5 min. The behavioural goal is for par -
ticipants to work towards achieving at least 30  min of 
Snacktivity™ per day. The Snacktivity™ intervention aims 
to promote participation in Snacktivity™, the usefulness 
of Snacktivity™, encourages regular self-monitoring of 
Snacktivity™ to achieve sustained Snacktivity™, goal set -
ting for daily Snacktivity™, as well as action planning 
and implementation strategies for Snacktivity™. There 
are two main components within the Snacktivity™ inter -
vention; health professionals raising awareness of, and 
encouraging Snacktivity™ with participants in their con -
sultations, and the promotion of technology to support 
behaviour change and sustained engagement in Snacktiv -
ity™ (via the phone app called SnackApp™ and physical 
activity self-monitoring device. See later for details.
The Snacktivity™ intervention is based on self-regula -
tion theory and the habit formation model [28, 29]. Our 
own work and other studies have shown self-regulation/
self-monitoring to be an effective foundation strategy 
for health behaviour change [30–32]. Self-monitoring 
of Snacktivity™ may act as a reward for individuals who 
increase their physical activity behaviour, who are then 
provided with positive feedback from the monitoring 
process, thereby enhancing their motivation and reduc -
ing the potential for relapse. Frequent monitoring and 
reflection of Snacktivity™ progress may also improve self-
efficacy for participation in both short and longer bouts 
of physical activity. Encouragement of self-monitoring 
and recording of Snacktivity™ is a simple concept for a 
health professional to advocate as a public health com -
munication. It is simple for people to understand and 
implement. Trials have shown that participants can 
adhere to daily self-monitoring of physical activity [33]. 
An intervention logic model was developed to guide the 
content and nature of the intervention.
Snacktivity™ consultation
Participants will receive standard guidance about the 
importance of physical activity and any behavioural 
change strategies usually adopted by HCPs, but they will 
be advised to accumulate their physical activity through 
Snacktivity™. The intervention will start with delivery of 
the Snacktivity™ message. HCPs will also briefly discuss 
the purpose of Snacktivity™, the hypothesis underpin -
ning its principals, how it differs from standard physical 
activity advice, and provide examples of Snacktivity™. 
HCP’s will use a picture board that illustrates a range of 
activity snacks.
HCPs will promote the rationale for Snacktivity™ and 
the benefits of physical activity for health, give examples of Snacktivity™, explain implementation plans and action 
planning. HCPs will highlight to participants that Snack -
tivity™ will work best if they develop habits or routines 
and how participants can achieve this. The purpose of 
the physical activity monitor and SnackApp™ for facili -
tating self-monitoring of activity snacks will be discussed; 
use of this technology will be specifically encouraged. 
An intervention checklist will be completed by HCPs to 
aid delivery and provide a reminder prompt of areas that 
must be covered during consultations. We anticipate the 
delivery of the Snacktivity™ intervention to participants 
taking approximately 5 to 7 min. The role of the HCP is 
to simply raise the topic of Snacktivity™/physical activ -
ity, to signpost participants to the SnackApp™ for further 
advice and support, and to encourage participants to use 
their physical activity monitoring device to facilitate their 
engagement with Snacktivity™ and to obtain feedback.
If a participant is recruited via community settings, 
including third party organisations and social media, a 
researcher will call the participant and deliver the inter -
vention over the telephone. The consultation will be 
delivered following the same protocol and intervention 
checklist as is being used by HCPs. The delivery of the 
intervention by both HCPs and researchers will be audio 
recorded to assess fidelity (only if the participant has con -
sented to this).
SnackApp™ and physical activity monitoring device
As part of the intervention participants receive access to 
the mobile phone application SnackApp™ and are pro -
vided with a physical activity monitoring device (Fitbit). 
Technology-based interventions offer some key advan -
tages over traditional behaviour change interventions 
and have the potential to reach a large number of peo -
ple at a relatively low cost and offers increased access to 
the public at a time and place that suits their preferences, 
including the ability to overcome the need to attend face-
to-face sessions to receive the intervention. As a popula -
tion approach, smartphone-based interventions are very 
attractive as 90% of mobile phone users are in possession 
of their telephones 24  h per day. mHealth technology 
is applicable across the age and cultural spectrums and 
studies have shown that electronic devices that promote 
physical activity are acceptable [34, 35]. In earlier work 
to survey the views of the public about the Snacktivity™ 
concept, and the use of technology to support Snack -
tivity™, 90% of 724 respondents were found to own a 
smartphone and 45% used their phone to monitor their 
physical activity [17].
To facilitate habit formation the SnackApp™ will gener -
ate regular reminders and notifications for the interven -
tion group to engage in Snacktivity™. Self-monitoring 
may be particularly relevant for developing Snacktivity™ 
Page 8 of 15 Daley et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:45 
habits because it may be more difficult for people to eas -
ily recall how many activity snacks they have achieved 
each day. The design and content of the SnackApp™ is 
based on previous work packages, some of the principals 
of existing apps, and our previous experiences of devel -
oping apps for promoting physical activity and lifestyle 
behaviours. Participants will receive free access to the 
SnackApp™ after their consultation, which, within its 
functions, will contain features common in digital health 
interventions. Within these functions, the SnackApp™:
• Automatically captures/monitors daily physical activ -
ity and inactive time via a wrist worn consumer 
monitor (Fitbit Versa 2 device). It provides measures 
of steps, activity level, inactivity and energy expendi -
ture each minute. A companion SnackApp™ will be 
downloaded onto the clock face of the Versa to allow 
instantaneous feedback on Snacktivity™ progress 
throughout the intervention period.
• Classifies participants into an activity profile accord -
ing to their active and inactive time.
• Provides physical activity prompts after user-defined 
inactive periods, encouraging regular active snacks 
throughout the day.
• Generates individualised motivational push notifica -
tions to participants’ mobile phones based on prior 
behaviour and supports goal setting (both automatic 
and user-defined).
• Provides individualised feedback related to goal 
achievement to encourage adherence and facilitate 
self-efficacy. Individualised feedback will be pro -
vided on the accumulated number of physical activity 
snacks completed and total minutes ‘activity snack -
ing’ per day, progress towards meeting the recom -
mended level of physical activity for health benefits 
(150 min of MVPA per week) and the total number 
of minutes of physical activity, MVPA and the num -
ber of steps each day.
• Enables access to educational content (text, static 
images, video, and audio content) regarding Snack -
tivity™, both externally hosted and supplied by the 
research team, including examples of activity snacks 
(with instructive photos and gifs)
• Encourages social support via a forum to facilitate a 
Snacktivity™ social community.
• To promote habit formation, users will be able to 
plan when to perform activity snacks.
Training of HCPs/researchers to deliver the Snacktivity™ 
intervention
Those delivering the intervention will be trained by the 
research team to deliver the Snacktivity™ intervention following a standard protocol; we have developed a 
media-based training module that can be delivered 
face-to-face or remotely. We anticipate the training will 
take no more than 1  h given the involvement of HCPs/
researchers is simple and brief. The training tools will 
include information on the importance of adhering to 
the study protocol, the research study procedures, trial 
design and ways of delivering the Snacktivity™ interven -
tion. More specifically, the training aims to demonstrate 
different ways in which Snacktivity™ can be promoted 
by HCPs within the consultation (where appropriate). 
We have also developed video clips that show Snacktiv -
ity™ being delivered in GP practices, so that HCPs have 
an understanding of how the intervention might be deliv -
ered by them.
Intervention fidelity and contamination
With the consent of participants, the delivery of the 
Snacktivity™ information will be audio-recorded to assess 
for fidelity against the intervention component checklist. 
Those delivering the intervention will be trained on the 
importance of delivering the correct information to par -
ticipants according to their randomised group to mini -
mise the possibility of contamination. The Fitbit device 
and SnackApp will only be available to participants ran -
domised to the intervention group. A range of the strat -
egies to reinforce intervention fidelity will be used. We 
will.
• Develop a standardised training resource.
• Train HCPs/researchers to deliver the intervention 
according to the protocol.
• Explain the intervention logic model to HCPs/
researchers.
• Audio record all consultations and telephone calls 
with a researcher to assess whether the interven -
tion is being delivered according to the intervention 
checklist (with participant consent).
• Check for intervention ‘receipt’ and enactment by 
checking whether participants attended their consul -
tation and whether the physical activity self-monitor -
ing device and SnackApp™ are activated.
Comparator group
We are not proposing any change to standard care. 
The usual care group will therefore receive the normal 
physical activity advice and any typical behavioural 
change strategies adopted by HCPs within consulta -
tions. The usual care group will only receive the cur -
rent guidance for physical activity (to achieve 150 min 
of MVPA) within their healthcare consultation or dur -
ing the telephone call with a researcher, who will advise 
Page 9 of 15
 Daley et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:45 
 
they work towards the accumulation of at least 150 min 
MVPA per week. Participants will also receive a leaflet. 
With the consent of participants, the delivery of the 
usual care information will be audio-recorded to assess 
fidelity and intervention contamination.
Primary outcome
The primary outcome is the feasibility and acceptability 
of a subsequent phase III RCT according to pre-spec -
ified progression criteria. We are primarily interested 
in whether the Snacktivity™ intervention and trial are 
appealing to participants (assessed by the recruitment 
rate) and if the Snacktivity™ intervention and the evalu -
ation methods are acceptable to participants (measured 
by Snacktivity™/physical activity adherence and reten -
tion rates). We also wish to assess the recruitment and 
randomisation processes, measure the extent of any 
intervention contamination, and use data collected in 
the feasibility trial to review the sample size assump -
tions for the phase III trial.
Progression criteria for phase III trial and stop–go criteria
The decision of whether to continue to the phase III 
trial will be guided by the assessment of the data col -
lected during the feasibility trial (both quantitative and 
qualitative). For the quantitative data (Table  1), the fol -
lowing pre-defined stop–go criteria will be used:• Recruitment: defined as the number/percentage of 
people randomised against the recruitment target of 
80 participants over 5 months.
• Snacktivity™ adherence: defined as the number of 
physical activity snacks achieved (defined as mini -
mum of four bouts of MVPA lasting ≥ 2 min on aver -
age each day over 12  weeks) assessed by the Fitbit 
monitoring device (in the Snacktivity™ arm only).
• Physical activity adherence: defined as the proportion 
of participants who are accumulating a total weekly 
average of at least 105 min of MVPA (~ 15 min daily) 
(in the Snacktivity™ arm only).
• Attrition: defined as withdrawal from the trial and/or 
no follow-up data available.
Secondary outcomes
Data will be collected on outcomes that we plan to col -
lect in the definitive RCT at baseline and follow-up (see 
Table  2). While this feasibility trial is not powered to 
detect meaningful differences in these outcomes, col -
lecting this data means we can assess and ensure that 
there are no issues with the collection and comple -
tion of these measures in preparation for the phase 
III trial. We will calculate MVPA, total physical activ -
ity, light physical activity, sedentary time (i.e. inactive 
time during waking hours), and sleep (and other met -
rics that may become available through novel process -
ing methods) using data collected from a wrist worn 
research grade blinded accelerometer on participants’

non-dominant wrist (Axivity AX3; Axivity, Newcas -
tle, UK) for at least seven days in both groups. A self-
reported wake and sleep times log will be completed 
during the same days the accelerometer is worn. Other 
data collected at baseline and follow-up in all partici -
pants include self-reported sedentary behaviours (using 
the Workforce Sitting Questionnaire (WSQ) [36] and 
the sedentary behaviour item from the International 
Physical Activity Questionnaire [37], lower limb muscle 
strength (Takei dynamometer squat position), weight, 
waist circumference, blood pressure, and depression/
anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) [38], 
Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale [39] and Exercise 
Self-efficacy Questionnaire [40]. The Self-Report Habit 
Index [41] and a checklist of popular activity snacks 
questionnaire (Snacktivity™ checklist) are completed at 
follow-up in the intervention group only. Participants’ experiences of the trial will be captured in single item 
exit questions at follow-up, which includes questions 
relating to contamination. Specifically, participants are 
asked whether they know anyone else taking part in the 
study, and if so, whether they discussed the study with 
them.
We plan to conduct a cost effectiveness study in the 
subsequent phase III trial and the questionnaire items to 
be used to assess health care resource use and produc -
tivity will be piloted in this feasibility trial. The physical 
activity self-monitoring device (Fitbit) will provide the 
following data for participants in the intervention group; 
steps, distance, calories, bouted active minutes, inactive 
time, sleep and awake time, and wear time (through body 
sensor). The Snacktivity™ active minutes will be com -
puted from Fitbit device measured METs and activity 
snacks.Table 2 Schedule of assessments

Data collection
At baseline participants wear the axivity accelerometer 
for at least seven days before randomisation and com -
plete the baseline questionnaires (either using an online 
link or paper copy sent by post) before the baseline home 
visit. At follow-up, the accelerometer is posted to partic -
ipants in advance of their follow up visit, and the ques -
tionnaires are sent to participants once the follow-up 
visit has been booked (online link or paper as described 
above). The study visits will be conducted face to face by 
a member of the research team at participants’ home, a 
community venue or at their GP practice and completed 
in line with Government COVID-19 guidance, includ -
ing NHS infection control procedures. If in person data 
collection cannot be completed, assessments will take 
place remotely online or using video conferencing tools. 
All data collected from participants is stored in a secure 
password protected database. All participants will receive 
a £20 high street voucher at completion of follow-up. All 
data is collected according to a data management plan.
Collection of  SnackAppTM data
The Fitbit Versa 2 collects various measures of physi -
cal activity data and displays these data using a bespoke 
 SnackAppTM  clockface (see Fig.  3). The  SnackAppTM 
clockface, which is set as default, provides immedi -
ate feedback on the number of activity snacks, ‘active minutes’ (i.e. MVPA) and the number of steps users 
have achieved as measured by Fitbit Versa 2 watch. The 
clockface on the Fitbit smartwatch downloads the data 
to a ‘companion app’ via Bluetooth low energy which 
sit within the Fitbit app environment. With an internet 
connection, the companion app uploads the data to the 
Snacktivity™ application programming interface (API) 
where they are stored in PostgreSQL databases hosted on 
a secure encrypted Google server. Engagement analytic 
from the  SnackAppTM will be collected and defined as 
participants’ use and interactions with the  SnackAppTM 
and Fitbit clockface.
Adverse event reporting
There is no reason to assume that this trial will lead to 
an excess of adverse events. The intervention consists 
of HCPs/researchers promoting short bouts of MVPA 
within everyday life and use of a commercially available 
physical activity device to monitor activity, along with a 
mobile phone app to log movement, none of which are 
likely to create harm. Furthermore, the promotion of 
physical activity by health providers is already part of 
standard care and has been demonstrated as being low 
risk for all citizens in England as per the NHS Making 
Every Contact Count Campaign [42] without specific fol -
low-up for adverse events. Therefore, no adverse events 
will be collected.
Serious adverse events (SAE)
The research team at site (where applicable) will report 
all SAEs that are not defined as protocol exempt in an 
expedited manner. The following are ‘protocol exempt’ 
SAEs: events related to the participants pre-existing 
condition(s) (pre-existing conditions are medical condi -
tions that existed before entering the trial, or for which 
they have already consulted medical advice, as identi -
fied on the baseline questionnaire (as per the diseases/
conditions specified in Table  3)); and hospital visits for 
any elective procedures. Musculoskeletal and bone inju -
ries/fractures, and trips and fall injuries are regarded as 
expected SAEs and are recorded on the follow-up case 
report forms.
Statistical considerations and data analysis
The feasibility trial aims to recruit 80 participants 
over 5  months and the sample size is based on recom -
mended sample sizes for feasibility and pilot trials [43]. 
This means that we will be able to estimate a Snacktiv -
ity™ adherence rate of 65% to within a 95% confidence 
interval of ± 14.8% (based on n = 40); a physical activity 
adherence rate of 60% to within a 95% confidence inter -
val of ± 15.2% (based on n = 40); and an attrition rate of 
20% to within a 95% confidence interval of ± 8.8% (based 
Fig. 3 SnackAppTM clockface
Page 12 of 15 Daley et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:45 
on n = 80). Based on a response rate of between 1 and 
2%, 4000 to 5000 people will need to be invited to par -
ticipate in the trial to achieve the required number of 
participants.
A separate statistical analysis plan will provide a more 
comprehensive description of the planned statistical 
analyses. The data analysis for this feasibility trial will 
be mainly descriptive, and focus on confidence interval 
estimation, with no hypothesis testing performed and no 
p-values presented. A brief outline of the planned analy -
ses in relation to the stop–go criteria for this feasibility 
trial is provided. Recruitment and attrition rates will be 
analysed by pooling the two randomised groups. Adher -
ence (Snacktivity™ and physical activity) rates will be 
assessed for the Snacktivity™ group only. Progression cri -
teria will be summarised as proportions and percentages 
with 95% confidence intervals. We will collect data on 
the number of invitations sent, and aggregated data on 
the age and gender of invitees to compare with the trial 
participants.
Interview study
To gain further insight into the process of intervention 
delivery and receipt and the Snacktivity™ intervention 
we will ask participants to complete semi structured 
interviews about their experiences of the Snacktivity™ 
intervention. Questions informed by self-regulation 
and the habit formation model will focus on how often 
and how easy activity snacking is to do, how many 
snacks are achievable, ideal timing for snacking, barri -
ers to snacking, formation of habits and implementation 
strategies used. Feedback on the use of the SnackApp™ 
and the suggested activity snacks will also be collected. 
Questions will also be guided by the intervention logic 
model. We expect to complete 20–25 interviews which 
should allow for saturation to be reached, as recom -
mended for this type of study [44]. Purposive sampling will enable inclusion of participants who reflect as many 
socio-demographic characteristics of the possible eligible 
population (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic 
status, general exercise behaviour), and display different 
levels of engagement and participation with Snacktivity 
to capture the range of views.
Interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed ver -
batim and analysed using a framework approach [45]. 
As well as documenting individual and overall themes 
we will carry out theme comparison as appropriate, for 
example across socio-demographic characteristics and 
engagement level. Findings will be interpreted against 
and combined with other study data. This will help us to 
understand the intervention process and the participants’ 
experiences, allowing us to further refine the interven -
tion as necessary [46].
HCPs delivering the intervention will also be inter -
viewed to gain their views and feedback about delivering 
the Snacktivity™ intervention within their routine consul -
tations. We anticipate conducting 12–15 interviews with 
a range of HCPs. Interviews will be recorded, transcribed 
and analysed. Data will be interpreted as described above 
by means of overall and individual themes, theme com -
parison and in the context of findings from participant 
interviews and other study findings. Data will be used to 
inform and maximise participants experiences of receiv -
ing the Snacktivity intervention and HCPs experience of 
delivering the intervention in the Phase III RCT.
Trial oversight and management
The Trial Management Group, which includes two 
members of the patient advisory group, will meet regu -
larly (approximately every month) to ensure success -
ful implementation and delivery of the trial. They will 
monitor participant recruitment; any departure from 
the expected recruitment rate will be dealt with accord -
ing to the specific issues that arise. A joint independent Table 3 Protocol exempt SAEs relating to pre-existing conditions

Trial Steering Committee and Data Monitoring Commit -
tee (TSC/DMC) has been created for the Snacktivity™ 
feasibility trial. The TSC/DMC will meet at least twice a 
year or as required depending on the needs of the trial. 
The joint TSC/DMC will provide overall oversight of the 
trial, including the practical aspects of the trial, as well as 
ensuring that the trial is run in a way which is both safe 
for the participants and provides appropriate feasibility 
data to the sponsor and investigators.
Public and patient involvement
This trial is supported by a Public Advisory Group (PAG) 
that consists of 10 members of the public from a range 
of backgrounds with different attitudes towards physical 
activity. The PAG is facilitated by a public involvement 
Lead and PAG members contribute to the development 
of the Snacktivity intervention through attending quar -
terly meetings or completing tasks remotely (e.g. provid -
ing feedback on documentation). Progress updates will 
be provided in periods between meetings (either short 
online meetings or newsletter). The PAG will have input 
into the design and development of the phase III trial and 
will be invited to comment on all participant facing doc -
uments and strategies for recruitment. Two PAG mem -
bers will be part of the Trial Management Group and 
one PAG member will be attend the Trial Steering Group 
meetings. All PAG members will be offered an honoraria 
for involvement, which aligns to the National Institute 
for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Centre for Engage -
ment and Dissemination recommendations.
Trial progress
The trial has so far recruited 72 participants who have 
completed their baseline assessment and follow-up is 
ongoing. Recruitment to the qualitative study is ongoing 
and expected to be completed in February 2023.
Discussion
There is strong evidence that physical inactivity and 
high levels of sitting are associated with poorer health 
and mortality, yet the population has become less physi -
cally active. Interventions that can be delivered at scale 
to address these health behaviours are required. In previ -
ous research, we reported that the Snacktivity™ approach 
to promoting physical activity was viewed positively by 
the public [17, 18]. In this research, we are proposing 
that Snacktivity™ may be an alternative way of promot -
ing participation in physical activity to the public and 
assessing whether a full-scale trial is feasible. While there 
might be advantages to the Snacktivity™ approach, there 
may also be disadvantages. Snacktivity™ may be disrup -
tive to the day, it may be easily forgotten, or difficult to 
achieve MVPA in short bouts. It may also not impact health sufficiently, or it may be difficult for the public to 
think of ways to achieve Snacktivity™ or implement it 
into their everyday lives. Research needs to explore these 
possible issues and consider how any potential barriers to 
Snacktivity™ might be overcome and this trial will allow 
us to assess and understand any issues before embarking 
on a subsequent phase III trial. Using both quantitative 
and qualitative methods the results of this trial will pro -
vide robust evidence regarding the feasibility and accept -
ability of an alternative approach to promoting physical 
activity in the population.
