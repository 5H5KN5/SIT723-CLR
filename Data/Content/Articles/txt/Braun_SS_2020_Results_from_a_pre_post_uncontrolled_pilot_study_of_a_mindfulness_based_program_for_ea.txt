Abstract
Background: Mindfulness-based programs are a novel and promising approach for supporting teachers ’
occupational health and well-being. Although rationales for mindfulness programs for teachers have been offered,
the empirical research base evaluating approaches for educating teachers in mindfulness is still developing. This
study reports the findings of a pilot study of a mindfulness-based program. This study is unique in that it is one of
the only studies of the Mindfulness-Based Emotional Balance (MBEB) program to focus on early elementary
teachers, to be implemented by a new instructor, and to recruit teachers via extrinsic motivators.
Methods: A pre-post, uncontrolled pilot study of a 27.5-h mindfulness-based program for teachers was conducted
with 21 pre-kindergarten –third-grade teachers from the Pacific Northwest of the USA. Program acceptability was
assessed based on attendance and teacher reports of program benefits. Effect sizes for within-person changes (from
pre- to post-program) in teachers ’skills and mindsets, well-being, occupational health, and teaching practices were
calculated. Teachers also suggested improvements to the program.
Results: With regard to program attendance and acceptability, teachers attended 87% of sessions, with 58% of
teachers reporting a personal benefit and 58% of teachers reporting a professional benefit of the program. Effect
sizes for changes in teachers ’skills and mindsets ranged from small to large, | d| = 0.30 to 0.83, and ranged from
small to medium for changes in teachers ’well-being | d| = 0.07 to 0.48, occupational health | d| = 0.14 to 0.39, and
teaching practices | d| = 0.15 to 0.48. Teachers suggested shortening the program and linking it more closely to
their work in the classroom.
Conclusions: This study suggests that the MBEB program may be beneficial to early elementary teachers, even
when implemented by someone other than the program developer, and when provided with extrinsic motivation
to participate (more closely mapping to a larger-scale trial of the program). Teachers ’suggestions regarding
program length and structure are considered, along with useful avenues for future research on mindfulness-based
programs for teachers.

Key messages regarding feasibility
/C15What uncertainties existed regarding feasibility? The
feasibility of the Mindfulness-Based Emotional Bal-
ance (MBEB) program when implemented for early
elementary educators was unknown. It was also un-
clear how extrinsic motivation and implementation
by someone other than the program developer
might impact feasibility.
/C15What are the key feasibility findings? Teachers
attended 87% of sessions; 58% of teachers reported
personal and professional benefits of the program.
Effect sizes on program outcomes ranged from small
to large | d| = 0.07 to 0.83, and teachers offered
suggestions for adapting the program.
/C15What are the implications of the feasibility findings
for the design of the main study? Findings suggest
that the program can be offered to a wide array of
teachers, that those trained by the program
developer can competently implement the program,
and that compensating participants may not have
deleterious impacts on feasibility or program
outcomes.
Introduction
Teachers ’occupational health and well-being are im-
portant for their overall quality of life, as well as for the
well-being of their classes and students [ 7,38]. Mindful-
ness training, focused on the cultivation of conscious,
curious, nonjudgmental, and present-centered states of
awareness [ 29], has emerged as a novel way to teach the
cognitive and emotional skills theorized to support
teachers ’occupational health and well-being [ 45]. Al-
though several conceptual rationales for teaching mind-
fulness to teachers have been offered [ 24,46], a recent
meta-analysis of existing mindfulness-based programs
for teachers concluded that the empirical research of
these programs is still at its infancy [ 15]. The small body
of existing research has shown promising effects for
teachers [ 17,19,26,45], with additional research neces-
sary to demonstrate, with more rigorous study designs
and objective measures, the conclusive power of these
programs.
The present study contributes to this growing body of
literature by presenting the results from a pre-post, un-
controlled pilot study of the Mindfulness-Based
Emotional Balance (MBEB) program for early elemen-
tary teachers. This study aimed to (1) assess the pro-
gram ’s acceptability; (2) assess changes in teachers ’skills
and mindsets (mindfulness skills, self-compassion, cogni-
tive reappraisal, expressive suppression), well-being (men-
tal health satisfaction, life satisfaction, anxiety symptoms,
depressive symptoms), occupational health (personal ac-
complishment, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization,job stress), and classroom teaching practices (mindful
teaching, emotional support , classroom organization)
over the course of the program; and (3) explore teachers ’
suggestions for improvements to the program.
Logic model: theorized effects of a mindfulness-
based program on teachers ’skills, well-being,
occupational health, and teaching practices
The logic model for the MBEB program is depicted in
Fig. 1. Mindfulness training is hypothesized to build
teachers ’cognitive and emotional resources, which pro-
vide teachers with additional resources for coping with
everyday challenges, thereby improving their well-being.
Social-cognitive theories of job stress and coping posit
that feelings of job stress emerge when an individual ’s
resources are insufficient to manage the demands of the
situation [ 32]. By cultivating these cognitive and emo-
tional skills through mindfulness training, teachers are
theorized to feel more capable of meeting the demands
of their profession, whereby improving occupational
health. With more energy and less stress, teachers are
hypothesized to invest resources in classroom interac-
tions with students around learning (see also [ 46]).
Relation to teachers ’skills and mindsets
Previous studies of mindfulness-based programs for
teachers have shown them to be efficacious in fostering
change in (i.e., learning of) mindfulness skills and a self-
compassionate mindset [ 17,25,27,45]. Mindfulness
practice can also improve mindful emotion regulation by
increasing awareness of somatic and emotional arousal,
as well as the implementation of mindful coping strat-
egies to address such arousal (e.g., pausing and breath-
ing; see [ 23]). Existing studies suggest that teachers who
have acquired mindfulness and self-compassion skills are
more accepting of their own emotions, able to reappraise
situations in less stressful ways, and are less likely to
suppress emotional expression [ 15,25,53]. Emotion
regulation skills are important because they are a central
factor implicated in teachers ’levels of work-related
stress [ 36].
Of particular interest in this study is teachers ’use of
two emotion regulation strategies: cognitive reappraisal
and suppression of emotional expression. Cognitive re-
appraisal involves a re-conceptualization of a potentially
emotion-eliciting situation in a more positive or less
emotional way. It is a healthy regulation strategy which
is associated with higher levels of positive affect and
lower levels of negative affect, depressive, and anxiety
symptoms [ 21]. Expressive suppression is the modifica-
tion of the behavioral expression of emotion and is a
maladaptive strategy associated with exacerbated feelings
of negative emotions, negative affect and depressive
symptoms, low levels of positive affect, life satisfaction,Braun et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:178 Page 2 of 12
and job satisfaction and even students ’less positive out-
look and fewer prosocial behaviors [ 7,21,52].
Relation to well-being
Well-being has been conceptualized as the presence of
pleasant (e.g., life satisfaction) and the absence of un-
pleasant (e.g., depressive symptoms) emotional experi-
ences [ 30]. Through mindfulness and mindful emotion
regulation, mindfulness training is thought to improve
teachers ’personal well-being (Chambers et al., [ 10]). For
instance, because mindful individuals employ strategies
like cognitive reappraisal to put challenging situations in
perspective, they are less likely to feel overwhelmed, ir-
ritable, anxious, or defensive about current experiences.
Existing studies have demonstrated reductions in
teachers ’anxious and depressive symptoms, bad moods
at home, and greater home satisfaction and more sleep
over the course of their participation in mindfulness-
based programs [ 12,19,45].
Relation to occupational health
Teachers ’occupational health has been conceptualized
as the presence of pleasant (e.g., job satisfaction) and ab-
sence of unpleasant (e.g., emotional exhaustion) emo-
tional experiences in the work context [ 2,30]. It is
hypothesized that teachers apply mindfulness and emo-
tion regulation skills in ways that positively impact their
occupational health (e.g., job stress and satisfaction).
Empirical support for these associations come from
studies of the MBEB and Cultivating Awareness andResilience in Education (CARE) for Teachers program
with MBEB teachers reporting lower occupational burn-
out (specifically, less emotional exhaustion) and job
stress, less frequent bad moods at work, and greater sat-
isfaction at work than control teachers [ 12,45], and
CARE teachers reporting less psychological distress, a
composite of unpleasant occupational and personal well-
being indicators, and occupational burnout compared to
control teachers [ 25,27].
Relation to teaching practices
Mindfulness skills are theorized to improve teachers ’
practices in part through the adoption of an attitude of
kindness towards oneself and others [ 14], which may it-
self allow teachers to directly engage in responsive, high-
quality interactions with students. Mindfulness training
may indirectly affect the quality of teachers ’interactions
with students in the classroom by reducing feelings of
emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, which in-
crease teachers ’energy and capacity to empathize with
students [ 45,51]. Initial support for the association be-
tween mindfulness-based programs and teaching prac-
tices have been documented in CARE teachers engaging
in more emotionally supportive interactions with stu-
dents than control teachers at post-program [ 25].
Mindfulness-Based Emotional Balance program
The current study focuses on the 8-week, 9-session ver-
sion of the MBEB program, which met after school for a
total of 27.5 h [ 13]. In comparison to the 8-week, 11-
Fig. 1 Logic model of the Mindfulness-Based Emotional Balance program for early elementary school teachersBraun et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:178 Page 3 of 12
session, 36-h version of MBEB as reported in Roeser
et al. [ 45], this version differs in the following ways: ma-
terial originally covered in sessions 2 and 4 were covered
in one session; material originally covered in sessions 7
and 8 were covered in one session; and the length of the
retreats was shortened to 5 h each. The program was led
by a trained clinical psychologist who was also an in-
structor of mindfulness and movement. This was the
first time this instructor delivered this program, and the
new instructor was coached and trained by the program
developer, Margaret Cullen.
The topics covered in each session of MBEB are detailed
in Additional file 1. Approximately 30% of the MBEB pro-
gram is devoted to mindfulness-based emotion skills, 50%
to mindfulness-based stress reduction, and 20% to
mindfulness-based prosocial dispositions. The program
aims to cultivate teachers ’abilities to direct and sustain at-
tention intentionally and nonjudgmentally on present-
moment experiences through a variety of teaching formats
and guided home practices. Teachers are invited to apply
the content to their lives during the following week and
discuss their experiences with the practices and content
during each session. For more detailed program informa-
tion, see Benn, Akiva, Arel, & Roeser [ 6], Cullen & Pons
[13], and Roeser et al. [ 45].
One important note about the MBEB program in rela-
tion to other mindfulness-based programs is that the
MBEB program does not aim to scaffold and transfer
program-related skills specifically to the classroom con-
text, but rather invites teachers to explore and use these
skills in any area of their lives that they wish. This could
include their work context, but it need not (see Roeser,
[47]). In only one case are teachers explicitly asked to
apply the content to their classrooms —in a homework
assignment to practice loving-kindness meditation for a
student in their classroom that they struggle with. Be-
sides this, the program offers a platform for teachers to
learn the skills and apply them in their lives as they see
fit, without specific directives to use mindfulness in any
particular way or context. In this way, instructors aim to
support the wisdom and autonomy of the teachers tak-
ing the program.
Early elementary teachers
To date, the MBEB program has been tested on parents
and teachers of elementary-high school students with
special needs, and elementary and secondary teachers.
The program has demonstrated preliminary positive ef-
fects on participants ’skills and mindsets, well-being, and
teachers ’occupational health [ 6,45]. The focus of this
study was on pre-kindergarten to third-grade teachers
who serve young students as they transition into formal
schooling. Meeting the diverse needs of 30 young stu-
dents who are socially, emotionally, behaviorally, andacademically immature, for the entire day (i.e., these stu-
dents do not switch teachers during the day), are condi-
tions that do not exist in the same way for later
elementary and secondary school teachers, and are
major sources of stress for early elementary teachers [ 41,
43]. Thus, the present study contributes to the growing
body of literature on the MBEB program by studying for
the first time the effects of MBEB on early elementary
school teachers. This study is distinct from other tests of
MBEB in two additional ways: the current program was
implemented by a new instructor, rather than the pro-
gram developer, as was the case for previous studies of
MBEB, and this study assessed program impacts when
teachers may have been more extrinsically (e.g., school
leadership encouragement and payment) than intrinsic-
ally motivated (e.g., suffering) to participate, which may
more closely represent the teachers who would partici-
pate in the program should it be scaled up and dissemi-
nated more widely.
Present study
Pilot studies are a useful step in the research process
which help to determine the feasibility and acceptability
of a program and to explore possible population-specific
adaptations [ 3,8,55]. This pilot study of the MBEB pro-
gram for early elementary school teachers aimed to ad-
dress the following research questions:
RQ 1: To what extent did teachers attend and report
benefitting from the program?
RQ 2: Did teachers ’skills and mindsets, well-being, oc-
cupational health, and teaching practices improve across
the program?
RQ 3: How could the program be adapted to better suit
the needs of early elementary teachers?
We hypothesized that teachers would experience im-
provements in their skills and mindsets, well-being, oc-
cupational health, and teaching practices over the course
of the program. Due to the novelty of implementing this
program with early elementary teachers, the investiga-
tion into teachers ’acceptability and suggested adapta-
tions were exploratory and meant to inform future
iterations of the program.
Method
Design and procedure
The present study employed a pre-post, no-control
group design [ 8,16,22,39,54]. Data come from two se-
quential implementations of the MBEB program for pre-
kindergarten to third-grade teachers implemented in
two sites in an urban city in the pacific northwestern
USA: site 1 in the fall of 2013 and site 2 in the fall of
2014. The study was reviewed and approved by the
human-subjects research review committee at Portland
State University. Given the study ’s primary motivation ofBraun et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:178 Page 4 of 12
assessing the feasibility of implementing the MBEB pro-
gram under these novel conditions, a formal sample size
calculation was not warranted, with the goal of recruit-
ing as many teachers within the participating sites as
possible [ 33]. Each site received the MBEB program for
teachers and a social and emotional learning curriculum
for students. The present study focuses on the MBEB
program and changes in teachers ’experiences and teach-
ing practices.
Data were collected at two time points: at the start of
the school year (prior to the program) and at the end of
the school year (after the program). Teachers completed
an online survey containing questions regarding their
demographics, skills and mindsets, well-being, and occu-
pational health at each assessment. At each time point,
teachers were videotaped in their classrooms on 3 days
for 20 min. At post-program, teachers also answered
questions regarding the MBEB program in an online
survey.
Participants
The study drew teachers from two elementary schools
with linked preschool sites whose principals/leaders,
with district support, were interested in introducing
mindfulness and social-emotional learning to their
teachers and students. Schools were designated as Title
1 and served primarily economically disadvantaged fam-
ilies and children. In recent years, the schools increas-
ingly served immigrant families from Russia and Mexico,
although all teachers were European-American. The
teachers in this study were encouraged by their principal
to participate but could opt in or out of the program.
Participating teachers were paid for the time they de-
voted to the program. Thus, unlike other studies of
MBEB in which all teachers were self-selected, the mo-
tivation for teachers to participate in this study included
encouragement from school leadership and financial
payment for time. Participating teachers provided their
informed consent.
As teachers ’experiences at pre-program did not differ
by site, data were collapsed across the two sites/years of
the study. Teachers had a range of teaching experience
(M= 12 years, SD= 8); were 86% female, 100% Cauca-
sian; and 71% had a post-baccalaureate diploma or
graduate degree. In terms of grade, 10% were pre-
kindergarten teachers ( N= 2), 14% kindergarten teachers
(N= 3), 28% first-grade teachers ( N= 6), 10% second-
grade teachers ( N= 2), and 38% third-grade teachers ( N
= 8).
Measures
Attendance and acceptability
The number of teachers who enrolled in the study and
participated at each time point was recorded. Attendancewas taken at each program session. Teachers responded
to three questions about the acceptability of the pro-
gram: “How much would you say you ’ve benefitted per-
sonally from this program? ”and “How much would you
say you ’ve benefitted professionally from this program? ”
Responses were scored on a 1 to 5 scale (1 = Not at all
or very slightly ;5= Benefitted a great amount ). Teachers
were also asked “Would you recommend this program
to your peers who are teachers? ”Responses were Yes,
No, and Unsure .
Teacher skills and mindsets
Teachers self-reported on their mindfulness skills, occu-
pational self-compassion, and emotion regulation skills.
Mindfulness skills were measured using 38 items from
the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire [ 1], which
assessed five components of teachers ’mindfulness skills:
mindful observing, describing, active awareness, nonjud-
gement, and nonreactivity ( αpre= .92, αpost= .91). Items
were scored on a 1 to 5 scale (1 = Almost Never ;5= Al-
most Always ). Items included “When I ’m walking, I de-
liberately notice the sensations of my body moving ”
(observing), “I’m good at finding words to describe my
feelings ”(describing), “When I do things, my mind wan-
ders off and I ’m easily distracted ”(active awareness), “I
tell myself I shouldn ’t be feeling the way I ’m feeling ”
(nonjudgement), and “In difficult situations, I can pause
without immediately reacting ”(nonreactivity). Items
were scored so higher values indicate greater mindful
skills.
Self-compassion was measured using Roeser et al. ’s
[45] adaptation of Neff ’s[37] self-compassion scale for
teachers ( αpre= .85, αpost = .78). The scale assesses
teachers ’extension to compassion to themselves in the
context of their teacher role. Items were scored on a 1
to 5 scale (1 = Not at all True ;5= Very True ; e.g., “As a
teacher, I ’m tolerant of my own flaws and
inadequacies ”).
Cognitive reappraisal was measured using six items
from the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire ([ 20];αpre=
.88,αpost= .86). Items were scored on a 1 to 5 scale (1 =
Strongly Disagree ;5= Strongly Agree ; e.g., “I control my
emotions by changing the way I think about the situ-
ation I ’mi n ”).
Expressive suppression was measured using four items
from the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire ([ 20];αpre=
.67,αpost= .80). Items were scored on a 1 to 5 scale (1 =
Strongly Disagree ;5= Strongly Agree ; e.g., “I control my
emotions by not expressing them ”).
Well-being
Was measured using indicators of life and emotional sat-
isfaction, as well as teachers ’reports of anxious and de-
pressive symptoms.Braun et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:178 Page 5 of 12
Mental health satisfaction was assessed using a sin-
gle item, “Overall, how satisfied are you with your
emotional/mental health these days? ”Items were
scored on 1 to 4 scale (1 = Not at all Satisfied ;4=
Very Satisfied ).
Life satisfaction was assessed using a single item. “Tak-
ing all things together, how satisfied are you with your
life as a whole these days? ”Items were scored on 1 to 4
scale (1 = Not at all Satisfied ;4= Very Satisfied ).
Anxiety symptoms were measured using six items from
the State/Trait Anxiety Inventory ([ 50];αpre= .78, αpost
= .90). Items were scored on a 1 to 4 scale (1 = Not at
all;4= Very Much ; e.g., “I feel nervous ”).
Depressive symptoms were measured using 12 items
from the Beck Depression Inventory ([ 5];αpre= .69,
αpost = .81). Teachers were prompted about a topic
and selected the option (1 to 4) that most accurately
described their current state. For example, one item
prompted about sleep habits; options included the fol-
lowing: I can sleep as well as usual (1), I don ’t sleep
as well as I used to (2), I wake up 1-2 hours earlier
than usual and find it hard to get back to sleep (3),
and I wake up several hours earlier than usual and
cannot get back to sleep (4). Higher values indicate
greater depressive symptoms.
Occupational health
Was measured as teachers ’feelings of personal accom-
plishment, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and
job stress.
Personal accomplishment was measured using seven
items from the Maslach Burnout Inventory ([ 34];αpre=
.79,αpost= .89). Items were scored on a 1 to 7 scale (1 =
Never ;7= Every Day ; e.g., “How often do you easily
understand how your students feel about things? ”);
higher values indicate stronger feelings of burnout.
Emotional exhaustion was measured using six items
from the Maslach Burnout Inventory ([ 34];αpre= .92,
αpost= .91). Items were scored on a 1 to 7 scale (1 =
Never ;7= Every Day ; e.g., “How often do you feel emo-
tionally drained from your work? ”); higher values indi-
cate stronger feelings of burnout.
Depersonalization was measured using five items
from the Maslach Bu rnout Inventory ([ 34];αpre= .87,
αpost= .76). Items were scored on a 1 to 7 scale (1 =
Never ;7= Every Day ; e.g., “How often do you feel
you treat some student as if they were impersonal ob-
jects? ”); higher values indicate stronger feelings of
burnout.
Job stress was measured using nine items ([ 45];αpre=
.72,αpost= .71). Items were scored on a 1 to 5 scale (1 =
Strongly Disagree ;5= Strongly Agree ; e.g., “I feel dealing
with student discipline problems puts a lot of stress on
me”).Teaching practices
Were measured using teachers ’reports of their mindful-
ness while teaching, observer-rated emotionally support-
ive interactions with students, and classroom
organization.
Mindful teaching was measured using 20 items from
the Mindfulness in Teaching Scale ([ 18];αpre= .85, αpost
= .76). Items were scored on a 1 to 5 scale (1 = Almost
Never ;5= Almost Always ; e.g., “I am aware of how my
moods affect the way I treat my students ”).
Emotional support and classroom organization were
assessed using the Classroom Assessment Scoring Sys-
tem (CLASS [ 40];). At each time point, teachers were
videotaped three times for 20 min. Three certified CLAS
S observers watched the videos while taking notes about
the quality of teacher-student interactions and assigned
ratings about the quality of interactions for each dimen-
sion (1 = Low,7= High ): positive climate, negative cli-
mate, sensitivity, regard for student perspective, behavior
management, productivity, and instructional learning
formats. Approximately 35% of these videos were inde-
pendently rated by two observers, inter-rater reliability >
.85. Consistent with our logic model [ 46], scales were
created for emotional support and classroom
organization. Emotional support reflects teachers ’posi-
tive and negative classroom climate, their sensitivity to
students, and regard for student perspective, including
supporting student autonomy, ideas, and peer interac-
tions. Classroom organization reflects teachers ’clear,
proactive management of student behavior, productive
use of time, and employment of a variety of learning for-
mats that encourage student engagement. Observer
scores for each time point were averaged such that each
teacher received a score for observed emotional support
and classroom organization at pre-program and at post-
program.
Suggested adaptations
Teachers were asked two questions about the pro-
gram. The first, “How do you feel about the length of
the program? ”was scored on a 1 to 5 scale (1 =
Much too long ;5= Much too short ). The second was
an open-ended question, “What suggestions, if any,
do you have for the instructor for making this pro-
gram better in the future? ”
Data analysis
Attendance and acceptability
The number of participating teachers was recorded at
each timepoint in the study. The average proportion of
sessions attended was calculated, along with the propor-
tion of teachers who missed one or no sessions. The num-
ber of absences was also determined. Acceptability was
calculated using the proportion of teachers who reportedBraun et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:178 Page 6 of 12
that they “benefitted a moderate amount ”or more (scores
3–5). The proportion of teachers who would recommend
the program to fellow teachers was also determined.
Teacher and teaching outcomes
Descriptive statistics are provided in Table 1;c o r r e l a -
tions among variables of interest at pre-program are
displayed in Table 2. Effect sizes between pre-
program and post-program were calculated in R using
Cohen ’sdand correcting for dependence between
means ([ 54]; Fig. 3), with effect sizes of d=0 . 2c o n -
sidered small, d= 0.5 considered medium, and d=
0.8 considered large [ 42,49]. Confidence intervals for
these effect sizes are displayed as error bars in Fig. 3.
Suggested adaptations
The average response regarding program length was cal-
culated. Teachers ’free responses regarding their sugges-
tions were coded using qualitative content analysis [ 35].
Each response could contain multiple themes. The fre-
quency of each theme was calculated.
Results
Attendance and acceptability
During the first year of the project, 15 teachers from site
1 enrolled in the program; two teachers withdrew afterthe initial wave of data collection, but prior to program
participation (Fig. 2). During the second year of the pro-
ject, 13 teachers from site 2 enrolled in the program;
one teacher withdrew after two program sessions, and
four did not complete data collection. In sum, 21
teachers participated in the study and completed assess-
ments at pre-program and post-program: 13 teachers
from site/year 1 and 8 teachers from site/year 2.
Attendance for the 21 participating teachers was gener-
ally high, with 76% of participating teachers missing one
or no sessions. On average, teachers attended 87% of ses-
sions. Of the missed sessions, 31% were planned absences,
17% were sickness-related, and 52% were unannounced.
Teachers reported on the personal benefit of the pro-
gram, with 58% of teachers reporting that they benefit-
ted “a moderate amount ”or higher. Teachers also
reported on the professional benefit of the program, with
58% of teachers reporting that they benefitted “a moder-
ate amount ”or higher. Half of the teachers reported that
they would recommend the program to fellow teachers,
33% were unsure, and 16% reported that they would not
recommend the program.

Responses for the six teachers who responded were coded
thematically using qualitative content analysis. Three codes
emerged: positive comments o r responses suggesting no
changes; suggestions to streamline the program either
through shortening the sessions or limiting repetition of
content; and suggestions for exp licit instruction regarding
the application of program content to teaching. Of the six
respondents, three had positive comments or suggested no
changes. Two teachers suggest ed streamlining the program,
and two suggested explicit application of program content
to teaching.
Discussion
Results from this pilot study demonstrate that the MBEB
program can be implemented with, and have positive ef-
fects for, early elementary school teachers. This study adds
three new directions to the existing research on thefeasibility and success of the MBEB program: (1) the appli-
cation of this program to early elementary teachers, (2) a
test of program effects upon implementation by a new in-
structor, and (3) a test of program impacts when teachers
were extrinsically motivated (e.g., school leadership en-
couragement and payment vs. intrinsically motivated [e.g.,
suffering]) to participate. Under these novel conditions for
program implementation, teachers reported improve-
ments over the course of the program in all domains
assessed. These findings suggest that the program may
continue to have positive benefits when it is offered to a
wider array of teachers, that those trained by the program
developer can competently implement the program, and
that compensating participants may not have deleterious
impacts on feasibility or program outcomes. These find-
ings have important implications for the scale-up and dis-
semination of the MBEB program, together suggesting

health, and teaching practices. Solid bars indicate outcomes hypothesized to increase over time, and striped bars indicate outcomes
hypothesized to decrease over timeBraun et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:178 Page 9 of 12
that the MBEB program holds promise for school-wide
implementation. This study adds to the growing body of
literature on mindfulness-based programs for teachers
and the promise of such programming for promoting
positive change for teachers [ 15,17,25,45].
Teachers ’feedback suggested two specific directions in
which to adapt the program. First, analyses of teachers ’
free responses suggested that some teachers wanted more
scaffolding with regard to transferring mindfulness skills
to the classroom, despite the program being presented as
non-instrumental. This feedback suggests that the pro-
gram may not have met some teachers “where they were ”
in terms of their wanting to work on mindfulness primar-
ily for classroom change. Balancing the capacity of the
program to meet teachers ’personal and professional
needs will be useful in developing future iterations of the
program. For example, creating time at the end of each
session for tying the content to everyday challenges and
dilemmas of teaching practice may better suit the needs of
certain teachers andresult in greater improvements for all
teachers ’occupational health and teaching practices.
Teachers ’feedback also suggested that the program
was a bit too long, which brings to light the complex
interplay between dosage, duration, and culturally
adapted programming, which the field of mindfulness-
based programs has yet to fully explore. A key challenge
of prevention science is balancing the development of
evidence-based prevention programs that can be imple-
mented with fidelity, while also catering to the needs
and wants of those the program aims to support [ 4,9].
For example, a study of adaptations of an empirically
supported family-based intervention found that shorting
the program increased retention, but also reduced posi-
tive outcomes [ 31]. In the future, it will be important to
investigate how this program may be shortened to best
fit the busy schedules of early elementary teachers, with-
out jeopardizing the integrity of the program ’s content.
A strength of this study was its assessment of both pleas-
ant and unpleasant feelings. With most research on
teachers' occupational health and well-being focused on the
reduction of unpleasant emotions like stress and burnout
(e.g., [ 11,48,51]), this pilot study demonstrated that the
MBEB program has the potential not only to alleviate un-
pleasant feelings, but also prom ote positive feelings, such as
teachers ’satisfaction with their mental health. This is con-
sistent with the idea that mindfulness and compassion
t r a i n i n gm a yr e d u c es u f f e r i n g andcultivate flourishing [ 44].
This pilot study has several limitations, including a reli-
ance primarily on teacher self-report measures, and its
focus on a small, racially homogenous sample. In addition,
the processes through which these effects were inferred
were not directly tested. This is a useful area of research
that would contribute to our understanding of how effects
are achieved and could inform program refinements thattarget such pathways. There is much still to be learned
about the MBEB program for teachers and about the feasi-
bility of mindfulness-based programs more generally. This
pilot study brought to light several considerations that
warrant further exploration, including the best approach
to teaching mindfulness skills (e.g., through explicit appli-
cation to teachers ’lives in the classroom), finding the
“correct ”dosage, and whether such programs are suitable
for a diverse group of teachers.
Conclusion
The present study addresses calls to understand how
teachers ’social and emotional skills, well-being, occupa-
tional health, and teaching practices may be improved
through novel means like mindfulness training (e.g.,
[28]). Results from the present study add to the emer-
ging body of research suggesting that mindfulness-based
programs can positively impact teachers and their class-
room practice [ 15]. Pilot research, such as this study, is
useful in elucidating challenges and unanswered ques-
tions —perhaps especially in a small and growing field
like the research on teacher mindfulness programs. They
can also help to find practical solutions to complex im-
plementation issues on the way to more rigorous and
large-scale testing of mindfulness-based programs (e.g.,
[3,8]). The current study raises key issues to explore in
future research. We look forward to new scientific in-
sights on these key implementation issues as the field of
mindfulness in education advances.
