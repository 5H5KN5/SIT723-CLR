Abstract
Background: Interpreting evaluations of complex interventions can be difficult without sufficient description of key
intervention content. We aimed to develop an implementation package for primary care which could be delivered
using typically available resources and could be adapted to target determinants of behaviour for each of four
quality indicators: diabetes control, blood pressure control, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation and risky prescribing.
We describe the development and prospective verification of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) embedded
within the adaptable implementation packages.
Methods: We used an over-lapping multi-staged process. We identified evidence-based, candidate delivery
mechanisms —mainly audit and feedback, educational outreach and computerised prompts and reminders. We
drew upon interviews with primary care professionals using the Theoretical Domains Framework to explore likely
determinants of adherence to quality indicators. We linked determinants to candidate BCTs. With input from
stakeholder panels, we prioritised likely determinants and intervention content prior to piloting the implementation
packages. Our content analysis assessed the extent to which embedded BCTs could be identified within the
packages and compared them across the delivery mechanisms and four quality indicators.
Results: Each implementation package included at least 27 out of 30 potentially applicable BCTs representing 15 of
16 BCT categories. Whilst 23 BCTs were shared across all four implementation packages (e.g. BCTs relating to
feedback and comparing behaviour), some BCTs were unique to certain delivery mechanisms (e.g. ‘graded tasks ’
and ‘problem solving ’for educational outreach). BCTs addressing the determinants ‘environmental context ’and
‘social and professional roles ’(e.g. ‘restructuring the social and ‘physical environment ’and ‘adding objects to the
environment ’) were indicator specific. We found it challenging to operationalise BCTs targeting ‘environmental
context ’,‘social influences ’and ‘social and professional roles ’within our chosen delivery mechanisms.

Conclusion: We have demonstrated a transparent process for selecting, operationalising and verifying the BCT
content in implementation packages adapted to target four quality indicators in primary care. There was
considerable overlap in BCTs identified across the four indicators suggesting core BCTs can be embedded and
verified within delivery mechanisms commonly available to primary care. Whilst feedback reports can include a
wide range of BCTs, computerised prompts can deliver BCTs at the time of decision making, and educational
outreach can allow for flexibility and individual tailoring in delivery.

Background
Dissemination of best practice, usually via clinical guide-
lines, is rarely sufficient by itself to implement effective or
de-implement ineffective or harmful treatments [1, 2].
Observed variations in adherence to clinical recommenda-
tions are often poorly explained by routinely available pa-
tient or practice variables and are likely to be attributable
to differences in clinical or organisational behaviour [3, 4].
There is generally a need for active implementation strat-
egies to translate evidence into routine care [5]. Imple-
mentation strategies have important but variable effects
(absolute effect sizes range from 3 to 16% [1, 6 –11]).
Research resources are potentially wasted on randomised
trials of implementation strategies that do not advance
understanding of what makes such strategies likely to be
more or less effective [12 –15]. Attempts to improve this
understanding are often hampered by insufficient descrip-
tion of intervention content [10, 11, 16, 17]. Accurate
descriptions are needed to interpret heterogeneity of
effects within systematic reviews, inform replication of
promising features of implementation strategies and guide
the exclusion of less-effective features.
Many implementation studies focus on one clinical
behaviour or condition [18, 19]; it is uncertain whether
an implementation strategy developed for one problem
will work for another. This is particularly problematic
for settings such as primary care where clinicians need
to manage a wide variety of conditions. It is impractic-
able and inefficient to develop and evaluate an imple-
mentation strategy for every clinical guideline. Adaptable
strategies are required, which can potentially be general-
ised across different quality indicators and sustainably
integrated within existing resources.
Targeting implementation strategies according to
determinants of adherence (also known as barriers, en-
ablers, or facilitators that influence or affect behaviour)
may improve their effectiveness [16, 20, 21]. The Theor-
etical Domains Framework (TDF) offers a structured
approach for exploring the perceptions of those whom
are targets for the intervention [12, 22 –24], whilst the
Behaviour Change Taxonomy outlines 16 categories of
93 specific, theoretically informed or evidence-basedbehaviour change techniques (BCTs) that are hypothe-
sised to change behaviour [23, 25]. BCTs are observable,
replicable and irreducible ‘active ingredients ’that offer a
common language with which to describe intervention
content. There is a lack of guidance on how best to
operationalise, tailor content and combine BCTs to
enhance effectiveness. For example, motivation may be
increased by fear of negative consequences, but excessive
fear may inhibit action [26].
We previously screened the National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines and asso-
ciated quality standards to identify 2365 guideline rec-
ommendations considered relevant to UK primary care
[27]. Following a cross-sectional analysis of patient data
[4], we derived four ‘high-impact ’quality indicators
based on criteria including as follows: the burden of
illness, the potential for significant patient benefit from
improved practice, the likelihood of cost savings without
patient harm and the feasibility of measuring change
using routinely collected data. The four quality indica-
tors comprised the following: diabetes control (achieving
all recommended target levels of haemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c), blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol in patients
with type 2 diabetes); risky prescribing, largely focusing
on avoiding adverse gastrointestinal, renal and cardiac
effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) and anti-platelet drugs; BP control in patients
at high cardiovascular disease risk; and anticoagulation
for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation
(AF) [28].
We aimed to systematically develop an implementa-
tion package and adapt it for the four quality indicators.
Whilst intervention descriptions have previously been
coded for the presence of BCTs [25, 29], and the delivery
of intended BCTs [30], we have not yet encountered any
published studies prospectively evaluating intervention
content before evaluation. Prospective coding reduces
the likelihood of post hoc rationalisation whereby inter-
vention descriptions are influenced by knowledge of
evaluation outcomes [31]. In this paper, we will address
two research questions. First, were the BCTs we
intended to operationalise identified by an externalGlidewell et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:32 Page 2 of 16
coder during a directed content analysis? Second, which
verified BCTs were shared or unique to the implementa-
tion package adapted for four quality indicators?
Methods
We used an overlapping multi-staged approach adopting
an interpretivist stance to design and verify the content
of an implementation package adaptable for four quality
indicators using the BCT taxonomy (Fig. 1 & Table 1). All
research was undertaken in West Yorkshire, England,which covers a socioeconomically diverse population of
2.2 million residents [32]. Approximately 300 general
practices are organised within 10 clinical commissioning
groups (CCGs). Demographically, they are broadly typical
of the national average, with the exception of higher
deprivation levels [33].
Stage 1: selecting delivery mechanisms . We aimed to
create an adaptable implementation package based
upon resources typically available within primary care.

Commonly used delivery mechanisms known to be
effective [ 1] were selected by the intervention
development team: audit and feedback [ 8], educational
outreach [ 11] and computerised prompts and
reminders [ 10]. We aimed to embed evidence-based
features known to increase their impact, e.g. repeated
feedback of audit data, the requirement for users to
select a reason for over-riding a computerised prompt
[8,10].
Stage 2: identifying candidate BCTs . We aimed to
enhance selected delivery mechanism effects byembedding BCTs (e.g. ‘feedback on behaviour ’or
‘action planning ’[23]). Team members with experience
of applying behavioural theories to implementation
strategies (LG, RL, RM and RF) independently mapped
the 12 determinants from the TDF [ 34] to one or more
of the 16 broad BCT categories and then to individual
BCTs using an electronic spreadsheet. Results were
collated and any BCT category nominated by three or
more researchers was considered eligible. The team
discussed discrepancies until consensus was agreed. We
aimed to generate an inclusive list of ‘candidate ’changeTable 1 Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR)

techniques. A matrix was produced to indicate BCTs
with the potential to target one or more theoretical
determinants.
Stage 3: identifying and prioritising relevant theoretical
determinants of behaviour . We have earlier described
the methods and findings of interviews with primary
care clinicians and managers to explore determinants of
adherence [ 35]. Given the timeframe required to
analyse and compare four substantial sets of interview
data, emerging interview findings (themes and
illustrative quotes) based on interviewer field notes and
exploration of frequency data were compiled for each
indicator. We convened a series of multi-disciplinary
stakeholder panel meetings, one for each quality
indicator. The intervention development team used
their previous knowledge to identify stakeholders
involved in achieving each quality indicator. We invited
five to ten stakeholders representing clinicians (general
practitioners, practice nurses, pharmacists), practice
managers, quality improvement specialists and service
commissioners. All invited stakeholders were willing to
participate in the consensus process. We presented
them with emerging interview analyses [ 35] (frequency
data and illustrative quotes for each determinant of
achievement). After reviewing the range of determinants,
stakeholders were asked to suggest additional professional
or organisational determin ants and contextualise our
findings. Candidate BCTs (ide ntified during the mapping
exercise in stage 2) and messages which could be framed
were reviewed for potential fit within the organisational
context of primary care and feasi bility of operationalisation
within the different delivery mechanisms. Evidence-based
intervention features were discussed to explore their
acceptability prior to implementation. Field notes were
used to record discussion points. We simultaneously
convened a parallel group of nine patient and public
representatives and followed similar methods. The
research team communicated key messages from one
panel to another. Suggestions from both groups were
reviewed by the intervention development team, including
social scientists and clinicians, to maximise acceptability
and feasibility.
Following the stakeholder panels, we further analysed
interview findings using the TDF [34, 36] to identify the
most prominent determinants and high-level themes.
Determinants were grouped into four categories: core,
prominent, less evident and not identified. Determinants
considered core to all four quality indicators (i.e. consist-
ently raised regardless of quality indicator) were ‘social
and professional role ’and ‘environmental context and
resources ’; those considered prominent (i.e. determinants
which varied in importance) were ‘beliefs about conse-
quences ’,‘social influences ’,‘knowledge ’and ‘memory,attention and decision processes ’; and those considered
less evident were ‘skills ’,‘beliefs about capabilities ’and
‘motivation and goals ’. Determinants ‘emotion ’and
‘behavioural regulation ’were not identified . These data
informed the content of follow-up feedback reports.
Stage 4: designing intervention content . We created a
prototype outline for each delivery mechanism
(feedback report, educational outreach session and
computerised prompts and reminders) including
features known to enhance effectiveness [ 10,16] and
findings from stages 1 to 3. Computerised prompts
were not developed for diabetes or blood pressure
control because they were already widely used.
Stakeholders also suggested patient-directed checklists
to guide discussions around diabetes and blood pressure
control respectively. We then embedded candidate BCTs
(stage 2) that could target modifiable determinants of
adherence (stage 3). Using contextual data from
interviews, the prototype was adapted and tailored for
each quality indicator. We used the vocabulary and
experiences expressed in interviews with health care
professionals and stakeholder panellists to tailor BCT
content within delivery mechanisms. A graphic designer
enhanced the final intervention template. All prototypes
were reviewed by the intervention development group
for feasibility and acceptability prior to piloting.
Stage 5: piloting intervention content and refinement .
We piloted each delivery mechanism for all quality
indicators with five consenting general practices
involved in our earlier interview study [ 35]. Brief
opportunistic semi-structured interviews were con-
ducted by EI a social scientist researcher, previously un-
known to the practice. She directly observed the
delivery of each educational outreach session. Feedback
reports, patient-directed checklists and protocols for
computerised prompts were presented as written
documents. She conducted brief, opportunistic semi-
structured interviews with relevant practice staff (six
GPs, two practice managers and three practice nurses).
Participants commented on the acceptability and
feasibility of prototype delivery mechanisms. Field notes
were taken and reviewed by the intervention development
team, leading to refinements of the first feedback re-
port template. Participants were not asked to comment
on the presence or absence of BCTs. The impact of BCTs
on hypothesised determinants was not explored when
piloting interventions.
Stage 6: verification of BCTs included within
implementation packages. Three trained coders (LG, RL
and KG-B) applied the BCT Taxonomy version 1 in
two stages to identify intended and verified BCTs [ 23].
First, two members of the intervention development
team (LG and RL) assessed which BCTs were includedGlidewell et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:32 Page 5 of 16
in a sample of delivery mechanisms (feedback reports,
educational outreach visit plan for one quality indicator)
to identify intended content. A directed content analysis
exploring the consistency of identification was completed
by a researcher external to the intervention development
team (KG-B) [ 37]. All implementation package delivery
mechanisms were coded to one or more BCTs
independently by LG and KG-B. Discrepancies were
noted and decisions made about sufficient evidence to
verify inclusion. We then examined the extent to which
BCT content was shared across (or unique to) the
adapted implementation package and different delivery
mechanisms.
Ethics
The ASPIRE programme was reviewed by the Leeds
Central Research Ethics Committee in June 2012 (12/
YH/0254) and National Health Service research govern-
ance permissions granted by the West Yorkshire
Commissioning Support Unit.
Results
BCTs with the potential to target one or more theoret-
ical determinants (Table 2) were identified in a matrix
(Table 3). We identified 30 BCTs with potential to target
determinants from our emerging interview study find-
ings and stakeholder panellists (Additional file 1: Table
S1 and Table 4). BCTs that could not be operationalised
within our delivery mechanisms or fit within the context
of primary care resources were considered ineligible
(Table 5).
The implementation package adapted for four quality
indicators
We tailored delivery mechanisms for each quality indica-
tor: audit and feedback, educational outreach and com-
puterised prompts and reminders. Full operational
details of how each delivery mechanism was developed
and intended to be delivered have been specified follow-
ing TIDieR guidance [38] (Table 3). Audit and feedback
comprised quarterly reports, computerised searches to
identify patients and significant event audit templates to
support root cause analyses (risky prescribing; anticoa-
gulation for AF). Report content was designed to inform
and prompt memory of clinical targets, highlight conse-
quences of not changing behaviour, suggest potential
strategies for change, give feedback on outcomes/behav-
iour, compare adherence with others, encourage goal
setting and use of an action plan template and encour-
age reflection on progress towards goals. Educational
outreach comprised an initial 30-min session to focus on
action planning, increase motivation, discuss barriers to
action, facilitate group reflection and increase confidence
to act. Sessions were facilitated by pharmacists following2 days training. A follow-up session was available to
review goal achievement and create more challenging or
attainable plans. Two days of pharmacist support were
offered to support patient identification and review.
Computerised prompts and reminders were created to
reinforce clinical messages of who and what to target for
each indicator. Nine computerised prompts for risky
prescribing and two for anticoagulation for AF requiring
a one-click justification (e.g. continue with risk, add
medication, or stop medication) were developed. To
avoid duplication with existing quality improvement sys-
tems, we did not develop computerised prompts for dia-
betes control or BP control [39]. Laminated reminders
were created to convey key clinical information for BP
control, anticoagulation for AF and risky prescribing.
Patient-directed checklists to facilitate shared decision
making were developed for distribution by practice staff
in BP control and diabetes control practices.
Identification of BCTs included within adapted
implementation packages
The directed content analysis identified the BCTs em-
bedded within the adapted implementation packages for
four quality indicators. Each implementation package in-
cluded at least 27 out of 30 potentially applicable BCTs
(Additional file 1: Table S1), representing 15 of 16 BCT
categories across the range of intervention delivery
mechanisms. Each package contained multiple unique
instances of the different BCTs. Four BCTs that were
intended for inclusion ( ‘identification of self as a role
model ’and ‘verbal persuasion about capability ’in educa-
tional outreach, ‘discrepancy between current behaviour
and goal ’in feedback reports, and ‘anticipated regret ’in
feedback reports and educational outreach) could not be
verified.
Extent of shared and unique BCT content across adapted
implementation packages and delivery mechanisms
Adapted implementation packages for the different qual-
ity indicators shared common and unique BCT content.
Twenty-three BCTs were shared across all four quality
indicators (Additional file 1: Table S1). Twenty-seven
BCTs were identified in strategies targeting risky pre-
scribing and BP control, and 30 targeting anticoagulation
for AF and diabetes control. Seven BCTs were unique to
implementation packages largely focused on changing
processes of care (risky prescribing and anticoagulation
for AF contained BCTs relating to ‘goal setting for be-
haviour ’and ‘monitoring of behaviour ’) and five BCTs
were unique to packages targeting patient outcomes (BP
control and diabetes control contained BCTs relating to
‘goal setting for outcomes ’and ‘monitoring for out-
comes ’). We did not operationalise ‘goal setting for
behaviour ’or ‘monitoring of behaviours ’for the qualityGlidewell et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:32 Page 6 of 16

Rationale We aimed to develop an adaptable implementation package which can be implemented within existing primary care systems and resources and ad apted to specifically
target barriers to change for four quality indicators.
Control
interventionsBoth control and intervention practices will be exposed to standard practice quality improvement initiatives e.g. national guidelines and financi al incentives.
Materials and
trainingPractice-specific quarterly audit reports
Each report contained a comparison of the practices ’
behaviour or outcomes in relation to the other participating
practices within their locality (i.e. their Clinical Commissioning
Group responsible for commissioning services) and all
participating practices across West Yorkshire to reflect on
progress and to prompt the need for change. Information on
clinical recommendations and potential change strategies were
provided. Consequences of inaction were described. Practices
were encouraged to set goals based on graded tasks (based on
the number of clinical recommendations and number of patients
to be targeted within each recommendation) and use an action
planning template to detail who would do what; in what
circumstances; and how and when the achievement would be
reviewed. Subsequent reports included potential actions identified
during outreach sessions.
Computerised searches
Searches could be included in the practice ’s Clinical Information
System (CIS) to systematically identify all patients whose care
should be reviewed and facilitate repeat searching.
Short and longer significant event audit (SEA) templates
Short and longer forms were developed for risky prescribing
and anticoagulation for AF indicators to facilitate root cause
analyses and action planning from harmful events or near
misses.We commissioned for and recruit ed experienced Pharmacist
facilitators who received 2 days training aimed to increase
motivation, prompt individual and group reflection, increase
confidence and intention to act. For each outreach visit, a
practice-specific outreach pack was developed containing:
the most recent (and all previous) audit report(s); a session
outline; an action plan template that included space for
noting current performance, setting a target, identifying who
will do what and review date; and templates for assessing
costs and benefits. We did not articulate the discrepancy or
specifically request that the team did so and although it is
possible that the team might do this, they might also explain
the lack of achievement away in other ways and not those
related to behaviours. As we can only infer that this technique
was deployed we did not code for it. Training in BCT coding
requires that inferences are not made.For risky prescribing nine computerised prompts were
developed to be triggered within the consultation and
during repeat prescribing on the basis of a clinical code
algorithm for age/diagnosis/drug and duration. When
triggered a brief message notified that the patient was
at risk and presented one sentence of evidence-based
risk (e.g. ‘This patient has CKD. NS AID use accounts for
an estimated 15% of all cases of acute renal failure and
36% of drug-induced cases ’). A one-click justification
was required (e.g. continue with risk, add medication,
or stop medication).
Two prompts were developed for anticoagulation for
AF but could not be made available within the study
timelines.
Patient-directed checklists
Checklists were developed to facilitate shared decision
making for managing blood pressure and diabetes
outcomes but could not be made available within the
study timelines so were not included in the directed
content analysis.
Paper-based reminders in the form of laminated
information sheets were created to convey key clinical
information (blood pressure, risky prescribing and
anticoagulation for AF).
Pens and post-it notes were sent to all practices with a
topic specific reminder to prompt behaviour.
Supportive
activitiesNone. Pharmacist training included a one-day face-to-face meeting
with intervention developers fo cussing on goal setting, action
planning, clinical barriers, and persuasive communication. This
was followed by a half day of independent study using a folder
of supporting documentation rele vant to each clinical priority.
The first outreach meeting of each facilitator was observed by
an experienced facilitator and feedback was given.None.

indicators relating to BP and diabetes control that
focussed on outcomes of behaviour. This was only iden-
tified during the verification exercise once interventions
had been delivered to participants.
It was possible to operationalise and identify intended
BCTs within audit and feedback more frequently than
for the other delivery mechanisms. Feedback reports for
diabetes control and anticoagulation for AF contained
29 BCTs, compared to 28 for BP control and 26 for risky
prescribing. Diabetes reports contained BCTs relating to
‘habit formation ’,‘reviewing outcome goals ’and sugges-
tions for ‘restructuring the social environment ’. Educa-
tional outreach for BP control and anticoagulation for
AF contained 17 BCTs. Diabetes control and risky
prescribing outreach contained 16 BCTs. ‘Goal setting
outcome ’was not operationalised for risky prescribing
nor anticoagulation for AF. ‘Information about social/
environmental consequences ’was not identified for dia-
betes control. ‘Behavioural contract ’and ‘commitment ’
were only designed to be included in significant event
audit templates developed for risky prescribing and
anticoagulation for AF and no other delivery mechan-
ism. Computerised prompts were limited in the number
of BCTs they could include because of their brevity but
included additional BCTs not included in other mecha-
nisms, ( ‘prompts/cues ’,‘pros/cons ’,‘adding objects to the
environment ’,‘conserve mental resources ’and ‘credible
source ’). Paper-based reminders included ‘prompts and
cues ’and ‘conserving mental resources ’.
Our extended analysis of interview findings using the
TDF identified ‘environmental context ’and ‘social influ-
ences ’as core determinants across all indicators. Ante-
cedent BCTs to target these determinants were
particularly challenging to include in our chosen delivery
mechanisms (i.e. we prospectively excluded the BCTs‘distraction ’,‘body changes ’and ‘avoidance ’). ‘Adding
objects to the environment ’was only operationalised in
the computerised prompts developed for risky prescrib-
ing and anticoagulation for AF. Advice on ‘restructuring
the physical environment ’and ‘restructuring the social
environment ’were only included in BP control and
diabetes control feedback reports respectively.
Discussion
We have provided a detailed description of the core
BCTs that can be identified across an adaptable imple-
mentation package and those unique to a range of deliv-
ery mechanisms commonly available to the UK primary
care setting. Whilst published intervention descriptions
have previously been reliably coded for the presence of
BCTs [25, 29] and the delivery of intended BCTs [30],
we believe that intervention content has not previously
been coded prospectively by someone external to the
development team prior to evaluation.
In our prospective assessment of the extent to which
BCTs were verified, we identified a large proportion of
shared BCTs (at least 23 of 30 eligible BCTs) represent-
ing 15 of 16 BCT categories, suggesting that prioritised
BCTs can be embedded and identified across delivery
mechanisms adapted for different quality indicators.
Whilst educational outreach appeared to contain fewer
BCTs, it was designed to be co-delivered with feedback
reports. It was possible to include a greater range of
BCTs in educational outreach because of the face-to-
face delivery of outreach (e.g. ‘graded tasks ’) and the co-
delivery of audit and feedback reports. We did not verify
if BCTs targeted intended determinants of behaviour
nor could we verify the presence of four BCTs, implying
their operationalisation was unsuccessful or that these
BCTS are less visible.Table 5 Behaviour change techniques excluded from intervention development or intended but not subsequently identified during

Previous research retrospectively identifying BCTs
within a systematic review of interventions for diabetes
care targeting healthcare professionals [40] identified
seven BCTs. We identified a broader range of included
BCTs, at least 27 in each of our four adapted implemen-
tation packages, incorporating many of those not identi-
fied in the systematic review of diabetes interventions.
This could be because we used a prospective identifica-
tion process, or because we attempted to target a wider
range of behavioural determinants identified from our
interview and stakeholder panel findings.
Limitations
We had to make trade-offs between what is theoretically
desirable, clinically acceptable and operationally feasible
within the context of delivery mechanisms and primary
care resources. These trade-offs are partly reflected in
our main study limitations.
Firstly, there were limitations in how we assessed and
prioritised determinants of behaviour and subsequently
linked them to BCTs. We acknowledge that perceptions
of determinants are not necessarily predictors of behav-
iour [41]. We did not quantify the importance of each
belief within determinants nor the relative importance of
each determinant to the target population [42].
Therefore, it was not possible to identify individual
psychological theories and use their corresponding
evidence-based measures and instruments to develop
each implementation package [43, 44]. We used emer-
ging and extended interview findings to inform interven-
tion development. It was not possible within our
research timelines to use the extended findings to
inform adaptation of educational outreach or initial
feedback reports. We may not have adequately operatio-
nalised BCTs to target core and prominent determinants
(‘social and professional role ’and ‘environmental context
and resources ’) within the following categories: ‘social
support ’,‘antecedents ’,‘identity ’and ‘covert learning ’to
target the determinants.
Secondly, BCTs from social cognition models and the
TDF more generally focus on individual cognitions and
may be insufficient to adequately target team, patient or
organisational determinants.
Thirdly, although we aimed to develop an implementa-
tion package which could be adapted to target four (and
potentially other) quality indicators, whether or not it is
consistently effective is an empirical question. Whilst de-
terminants of practice may only be relevant to countries
with a comparable primary care organisation, methods
to identify candidate BCTs and verify their presence are
transferable.
Fourthly, despite the fact that trained and experienced
coders conducted the directed content analyses, they
may have omitted less-visible BCTs or over-coded BCTcontent. To minimise bias, a coder external to the inter-
vention team conducted the directed content analysis.
Whilst a single researcher performed the prospective
content analysis, they had undertaken the BCT
Taxonomy online training and a number of quality as-
surance steps (e.g. staged review of documents, meeting
to discuss discrepancies). As coding was only conducted
by two coders at each stage, it was considered inappro-
priate to statistically assess the reliability of this exercise,
and more informative to identify discrepancies and
discuss why these occurred and what could be done in
subsequent research to improve the operationalisation of
these techniques during intervention development.
Coders will vary in the knowledge, skills and experience
that they bring and may vary in their judgements of the
presence/absence of BCTs.
Fifthly, the independent coder could not identify four
BCTs that we intended to embed: ‘identification of self
as role model ’,‘imaginary punishment ’,‘anticipated regret ’
and ‘discrepancy between current behaviour and goal ’).
Coding discrepancies suggested that there is scope to
either improve the operationalisation of some BCTs or
the training provided prior to coding for BCTs.
Lastly, because of our research timelines, it was not
feasible to draw out the high-level themes from the
interview analyses or to modify interventions to address
unsuccessful operationalisation as interventions were
coded following dissemination of the fifth and final audit
report. Adapting intervention content to include evidence-
based findings in multiple domains (e.g. behavioural science
and features known to enhance the effect size of implemen-
tation interventions) is challenging to deliver within re-
search budgets and timescales . Future work could benefit
from building in more time for iterative cycles to refine in-
terventions and assessing the consistency of verification by
coders with different skills and experience.
Implications for research
We suggest that the methods and transparency of devel-
oping complex interventions to promote the implemen-
tation of evidence-based practice would be advanced by
reporting the following: candidate BCTs considered
eligible following an analysis of key behavioural determi-
nants; BCTs targeting key determinants that could not
be included within chosen delivery mechanisms, within
the constraints of project resources, or implementation
context; and the degree of success in operationalising
and verifying intended BCTs. It is important to identify
and report potentially eligible techniques that could not
be verified for the following reasons. Firstly, process
evaluations could explore whether interventions do not
work because BCTs intended to target the most import-
ant determinants could not be operationalised. Secondly,
implementation researchers can consider how prioritisedGlidewell et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:32 Page 13 of 16
determinants and salient BCTs could be operationalised
within alternative delivery mechanisms. Thirdly, there
may be scope to add to the existing BCT taxonomy novel
BCTs that can be operationalised within different delivery
mechanisms.
During our research, Cane et al. mapped the 93 BCTs
to theoretical determinants [45] building on the earlier
work of Michie and colleagues [34]. We identified many
of the same BCTs. In addition, Cane identified two
categories of BCTs that we did not, feedback and moni-
toring, and antecedents were mapped to knowledge, and
antecedents to skills. Whilst these were not included in
our intervention development work, we did include
shaping knowledge, natural consequences and compari-
son of behaviour and outcomes to target knowledge.
Shaping knowledge, comparison of behaviour and repeti-
tion and substitution BCTs were included to target skills.
Michie is currently leading work to advance this line of
research, including the development of an ontology for
linking BCTs to theoretical determinants [46].
More research is required to establish how to best oper-
ationalise antecedent BCTs to target the determinants ‘en-
vironmental context and resources ’and ‘social influences ’
(both team and patient). Whilst BCTs to target organisa-
tional determinants are available, they were harder to oper-
ationalise because they involve addressing relatively
complex systems and social processes. We were aware of
the importance of patient factors but prioritised our effort
and resources on changing prof essional behaviour. We also
recognised that there is a much larger body of research on
changing patient behaviour (e.g. for diabetes) that we could
not address within the constraints of one research
programme. We did partly try to address this shortcoming
by developing patient-directed checklists but could not
complete these to our satisf action within our timelines.
We do not know if there is an additive, synergistic or
negative effect of operationalising multiple BCTs within
a BCT category. Whilst implementation packages
contained one or more instances of the BCT, we did not
quantify the ‘dose ’given. Further, we only assessed the
presence of the BCT and not whether the BCT effect-
ively targeted the most salient determinants of behav-
iour. Previous research identifying the BCT content of
diabetes implementation strategies has suggested that
there is strength in harnessing the potential of BCTs to
change multiple behaviours [40].
Many BCTs originate from health psychology theories
developed to understand why patients do not change their
behaviour; changing or not changing may result in health
consequences for those individuals. The applicability of this
evidence base for professionals who do not personally ex-
perience health consequences needs to be further explored.
Delivery mechanisms such as audit and feedback are
potentially relatively efficient to deliver if drawing uponroutinely collected data but they are unable to guarantee
the delivery, uptake and engagement of BCTs that require
more intensive and expensive delivery mechanisms such as
educational outreach (e.g. ‘graded tasks ’,‘problem solving ’,
‘action planning ’and ‘commitment ’) which allows for
tailoring and engagement at the practice level.
The effectiveness of our implementation packages is
being rigorously evaluated in a pair of cluster rando-
mised controlled trials [28]. A parallel process evaluation
will determine what was actually delivered, received and
acted upon. The analysis will draw upon both Normal-
isation Process Theory [47, 48] and the TDF [35, 45].
The TDF was applied to help compare planned versus
actual intervention content. Normalisation Process
Theory was adopted given its relevance to understanding
implementation processes, particularly how individuals
and groups conceive of, engage with, enact and reconfig-
ure work in response to an intervention. Our ongoing
trials and process evaluations [28] of these packages will
not identify BCTs that act together or independently to
enhance effectiveness and this should be explored in
subsequent research. We invite others to build upon and
improve our methods in reporting the BCT content of
implementation interventions.
Conclusion
Implementation researchers need to identify effective
and efficient means of selecting and adapting implemen-
tation strategies across a range of targeted quality indica-
tors, rather than propose a new trial for every indicator
(Table 5). We have demonstrated the specification and
verification of BCT content for an adaptable implemen-
tation package targeting four quality indicators. We
identified variable numbers of BCTs across the four
adapted implementation packages and delivery mecha-
nisms but would not claim that ‘more is better ’; the abil-
ity to effectively target the most salient behavioural
determinants is likely to be more important, although
some delivery mechanisms may lend themselves better
to adaptation than others. Whether or not an adapted
implementation package is actually effective in targeting
our four indicators, or others, is an empirical question.
