Abstract
Background: More research on sustainment of interventions is needed, especially return on investment (ROI)
studies to determine cost-benefit trade-offs for effort required to sustain and how much is gained when
effective programs are sustained. The ROSE sustainment (ROSES) study uses a sequential multiple assignment
randomized (SMART) design to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a stepwise approach to
sustainment of the ROSE postpartum depression prevention program in 90 outpatient clinics providing prenatal care to
pregnant women on public assistance. Postpartum depression (PPD) is common and can have lasting consequences.
Outpatient clinics offering prenatal care are an opportune place to provide PPD prevention because most women visit
while pregnant. The ROSE (Reach Out, Stay Strong, Essentials for mothers of newborns) program is a group educational
intervention to prevent PPD, delivered during pregnancy. ROSE has been found to reduce cases of PPD in community
prenatal settings serving low-income pregnant women.
Methods: All 90 prenatal clinics will receive enhanced implementation as usual (EIAU; initial training + tools for
sustainment). At the first time at which a clinic is determined to be at risk for failure to sustain (i.e., at 3, 6, 9, 12, and
15 months), that clinic will be randomized to receive either (1) no additional implementation support (i.e., EIAU only),
or (2) low-intensity coaching and feedback (LICF). If clinics receiving LICF are still at risk at subsequent assessments,
they will be randomized to either (1) EIAU + LICF only, or (2) high-intensity coaching and feedback (HICF). Additional
follow-up interviews will occu r at 18, 24, and 30 months, but no implementation intervention will occur after 18 months.
Outcomes include (1) percent sustainment of core program elements at each time point, (2) health impact (PPD rates
over time at each clinic) and reach, and (3) ROI (costs and co st-effectiveness) of each sustainment step. Hypothesized
mechanisms include sustainment of capacity to de liver core elements and engagement/ownership.

Background
More research on sustainment of interventions is needed.
A recent expert consensus report concluded that, “Little is
known about how well or under what conditions health
innovations are sustained and their gains maintained once
they are put into practice ”[1]. This report placed high pri-
ority on conducting return on investment (ROI) studies to
determine how much is gained when effective programs
are sustained and cost-benefit trade-offs for effort required
to sustain [ 1]. Limited empirical information on methods
and benefits of sustainment can result in (1) discontinu-
ation despite significant investment in initial implementa-
tion, or in (2) policymakers being unsure about whether
resources should be devoted to implementation and
scale-up [ 1]. The ROSE Sustainment (ROSES) Study eval-
uates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a stepwise
approach to sustainment of an evidence-based postpartum
depression prevention program in 90 outpatient prenatal
clinics serving women on public assistance.
Clinical context
Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common and impact-
ful public health problem, especially among low-income
women. A meta-analysis derived an average prevalence
rate of 13% for PPD within the first 12 weeks postpar-
tum [ 2]. Untreated PPD can have severe and lasting con-
sequences for mother and infant [ 3–10].
Low-income women have higher rates of PPD (up to
50%) [ 11–15] than do other income groups [ 16,17], are
less likely to receive treatment for their PPD [ 18,19], and
have more severe consequences of untreated PPD on ma-
ternal caregiving and child development [ 7,20,21]. There-
fore, timely and effective interventions to reduce their
PPD risk (i.e., to prevent PPD rather than treat a full
blown episode) are critical. However, health professionals
have remained focused on identifying and treating peri-
natal depression after its onset [ 22,23], rather than pre-
venting it. Outpatient clinics offering prenatal care are an
opportune place to provide PPD prevention because most
women visit while pregnant.
The ROSE (Reach Out, Stay Strong, Essentials for
mothers of newborns) program is an evidence-based
practice for reducing cases of PPD among low-income
and racially and ethnically diverse women [ 24]. Designedto address the high risk of PPD among low-income
women, ROSE is administered to pregnant women in
small groups, at outpatient clinics providing prenatal
care. ROSE teaches interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)--
based skills for improving communication and building
social support, identified risk factors for PPD. [ 2,25,26]
ROSE is presented as a course to minimize stigma and
emphasize the program as an educational experience.
ROSE consists of four 90-min group sessions and a
post-delivery 50-min individual booster session, with
easy to read handouts and homework for each session.
Two fully-powered randomized trials [ 27,28] and a ran-
domized pilot trial [ 29] support its effectiveness in redu-
cing cases of PPD among low-income women in the first
3–6 months following childbirth (Table 1).
ROSE is flexible, easy to implement, and can be deliv-
ered by individuals already working in prenatal clinics.
The ROSE manual is highly scripted. Nurses or medical
assistants can deliver ROSE. ROSE overcomes barriers
to attendance for low-income women by coordinating
sessions with women ’s prenatal clinic appointments and
having a flexible delivery structure (see Table 2).

Implementation and sustainment framework and rationale
Conceptual framework guiding choice of assessments
According to reviews [ 30–32], a program is sustained
where there is a continuation of its core elements at suffi-
cient fidelity, continuation of intended health benefits (i.e.,
prevention of PPD), and adequate capacity for continuation
of core elements is maintained. Capacity is “the extent to
which a community has local access to the knowledge,
skills, and resources needed to conduct the program effect-
ively”[32]. This definition of sustainment and the RE-AIM
framework (reach, effectivenes s, adoption, implementation,
and maintenance) [ 33] provide the conceptual framework
guiding assessments for this s tudy. Study outcomes include
reach (number of patients receiving and completing ROSE),
effectiveness (PPD rates over time), and adoption (time
from initial training to offering program). Implementation
consistency (i.e., fidelity t o core program elements) over
time is a primary outcome; implementation costs and pro-
cesses (e.g., adaptations, barriers) are secondary outcomes.
Our other primary outcome is maintenance (months ROSE
is provided with adequate fidelity). One hypothesized
mechanism (clinical and organizational capacity) is also de-
rived from our definition of sustainment. The other hy-
pothesized mechanism (en gagement/ownership) was
proposed by Shediac-Rizkallah and Bone to be an import-
ant facilitator of sustained capacity (they suggest that par-
ticipation ➔ownership ➔sustained capacity ➔sustained
program) [ 32]. The need for research determining the ROI
of sustainment comes from an expert consensus researchagenda on sustainment [ 34]. The need for an examination
of processes and our chosen predictors (organizational and
policy contexts) are clearly ar ticulated by all these authors
[30,32,34].
Implementation interventions being tested in current study
and rationale
Choice of implementation interventions for the ROSE
Sustainment (ROSES) Study is based on the replicating
effective programs (REP) framework [ 35]. For imple-
menting ROSE in prenatal clinics, all the implementa-
tion pre-conditions of REP have been met. We have
identified a high-burden condition (PPD), identified an
effective intervention that fits prenatal clinics (ROSE),
and packaged the intervention (i.e., it has already been
packaged for, tested with, and found feasible, acceptable,
and effective using prenatal clinic nurse health educators
as interventionists [ 27–29]).
Implementation and sustainment interventions used in
the current study are guided by the next three REP
phases. Enhanced implementation as usual (EIAU; ini-
tial training + tools for sustainment) will consist of
the pre-implementation steps shown in the framework
(see Fig. 1). Initial training will include an explanation
of the core elements, discussion about how delivery
can (and should not) be customized (see Table 2), lo-
gistics planning, and staff training (including training
of clinical staff and work with office staff to clarify bill-
ing, scheduling, and staffing). The two experimentalTable 2 Example ROSE core elements and adaptable periphery

sustainment conditions (i.e., low-intensity coaching and
feedback [LICF] and high-intensity coaching and feed-
back [HICF]) will contain lower (every 3 months) and
higher (every month) doses of REP ’s implementation
steps (technical assistance, ongoing support of and con-
versation with the clinics, coaching [including booster
training and process evaluation], feedback; Fig. 1). The
three implementation interventions provide varying
doses of guidance for re-customizing delivery and
making organizational and financial changes to sustain
the intervention, as suggested in the framework ’s
maintenance and evolution phase.
ROSE Sustainment (ROSES) Study aims
The ROSES Study evaluates cost-effectiveness of a step-
wise approach to sustainment of ROSE in 90 outpatient
prenatal clinics serving women on public assistance. Spe-
cific aims are to
1. Compare effectiveness of each sustainment step for
the following final and proximal outcomes:
a. Percent sustainment of core program elements
at each time point (primary) and total length of
time that (i) any ROSE services were provided
and (ii) were provided with adequate fidelity to
core elements.
b. Health impact (e.g., PPD rates over time at each
clinic) and reach (number of patients enrolled in
and completing the ROSE program).
c. Return on investment (cos ts and cost-effectiveness
of each sustainment step)
d. Hypothesized mechanisms including sustainment
of (i) clinical and organizational capacity to deliver
core elements, and (ii) a sense of engagement/
ownership by key clinic staff
2. Examine predictors and processes to determine
which kinds of clinics need which level of support:
a. Explore which clinic characteristics (e.g.,
organizational and state policy contexts) and
hypothesized mechanisms (Aim 1d) are associated
with best sustainment to determine tailoring
variables for choosing/ sequencing EIAU, LICF,
and HICF in the future.
b. Document implementation/sustainment processes,
their timing relative to desired outcomes, and
critical incidents to explore factors most related
to sustainment after accounting for hypothesized
mechanisms.
Innovation
The ROSES Study is innovative in that there are few
randomized implementation studies with sustainment as
primary outcome. In particular, identifying the “mini-
mum necessarily to sustain ”is a novel methodological[36] aspect of this study. In addition, the ROSES Study
is the first implementation study of a PPD prevention
intervention in outpatient clinics providing prenatal
care. In fact, virtually no interventions that prevent any
mental health problem among adults without requiring
the use of mental health clinicians have been the subject
of implementation research in outpatient medical set-
tings [ 37].
Finally, dynamic tailoring of implementation interven-
tions is needed to enhance the science of implementation.
Clinic and contextual factors lead to heterogeneity in re-
sponse to implementation interventions. The study ’ss e -
quential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART)
design, in which we adjust intervention intensity based on
risk of failure to sustain, addresses this heterogeneity. Re-
sults will build a needed evidence base for precision algo-
rithms for optimizing the allocation of implementation
resources to achieve sustainment.
Methods
Preliminary studies
Past work on ROSE
ROSE is effective at reducing PPD cases among low-
income women in community settings (see Table 1).
Given the highly scripted intervention manual, inter-
ventionists with varying qualifications (i.e., paraprofes-
sionals, nurses) have delivered ROSE with fidelity [ 38].
Delivering ROSE in prenatal clinics is feasible and ac-
ceptable to low-income pregnant women, with good
session attendance [ 39,40] and high perceived helpful-
ness of intervention components [ 27]. ROSE is also
feasible and acceptable to clinics serving low-income
women, as demonstrated by requests for the ROSE
manual and/or training across the USA and in Japan, as
well as surveys conducted in Michigan (see below).
Pilot work in Michigan
Included staff surveys in 13 prenatal clinics ( n=2 7 r e -
spondents). Data suggested that clinics were motivated
to implement ROSE. All respondents viewed preventing
PPD as “very important ”(n= 24) or “important ”(n=3 ) .
All but one respondent was “somewhat ”to“very”inter-
ested in implementing ROSE for their patients. Data
also suggested that clinics had a need for ROSE. As is
the case nationally, none of the surveyed clinics had
strategies in place to prevent PPD. Instead, most clinics
(11/13) tried to provide some regular screening for
PPD after birth, indicating that PPD is a priority issue.
Data also suggested that implementing ROSE in pre-
natal clinics is feasible. Ten clinics immediately identi-
fied staff that had adequate time and training to lead

leaders and manage workflow.Johnson et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:115 Page 4 of 12
When asked what about ROSE might be a good fit for
their clinics, respondents described a need ( “our patients
have significant modifiable risk factors, ”“at least half of
the pregnant patients are presenting with depression and/
or anxiety ”), and said that it is better to prevent PPD than
to deal with it after it occurs. They also mentioned the
non-threatening nature of ROSE (which does not require
women to endorse PPD) and the convenience of coming
to a familiar office. Implementation facilitators included
“We have numerous patients; low income, minority, his-
tory of depression, ”“nursing staff well aware of the social
problems our patients face, ”“group setting would increase
patients being seen and increase comfort, ”and “clients
more apt to attend visits. ”Using questions based on
Steckler [ 41], respondents agreed that ROSE would be
more effective in preventing PPD than current practices
and would improve quality of care at their clinics and dis-
agreed that it would be difficult to learn. Motivation of
staff to address PPD was viewed as a facilitator.
Clinics were also able to identify supports needed to im-
plement and sustain ROSE, which we integrated into our
study implementation conditions. On a scale from “1=s e r -
ious barrier ”to“7 = strong facilitator, ”staff training (4.2),
staff time and workload (3.4), billing issues (3.5), and space
(3.3) were viewed as neutral to slight barriers, but none was
seen as a serious barrier. In formed by these responses,
training, time and workload, billing, and space issues are
addressed in varying degrees in the three study conditions
(EIAU, LICF, and HICF). Respondents rated components of
EIAU, LICF, and HICF as important for successful imple-
mentation of ROSE at their clinics (see Table 3).
Critical design decisions
Rationale for implementation interventions and a SMART
design
The goal of the ROSES study is to determine the minimum
intervention needed to sustain ROSE in clinics that provide
prenatal services to women on public assistance and theoptimal timing of boosters. To a chieve this goal, the imple-
mentation interventions (EIAU, LICF, and HICF) were
chosen to reflect different inte nsities of a standard approach
to allow their intensity/cost aspects to take precedence.
When an intervention does not produce a desired outcome,
two options are available: to give it more time or step up
the intervention intensity. The study ’s SMART design al-
lows us to isolate the effect of intensifying an intervention
(i.e., stepping up to LICF or HICF) versus giving a simpler
one (such as EIAU or LICF) more time. It also builds an
evidence base for precision algorithms optimizing the allo-
cation of implementation resources to achieve sustainment.
Rationale for sample
We will enroll 90 outpatient medical clinics providing pre-
natal care in Michigan, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Penn-
sylvania, New York, and Florida. We chose to include any
kind of outpatient clinic for which ROSE would be appro-
priate (e.g., federally qualified heath centers [FQHCs],
hospital-affiliated clinics, independent practices, and visiting
nurses) in order to speed knowl edge acquisition relevant to
widespread scale-up. To be included in the study, clinics
will be (1) outpatient, (2) provi de prenatal services, (3) esti-
mate that at least 50% of their pregnant patients receive
some kind of public assistance (such as federal or state cash
assistance, food stamps, subsidized housing, and/or health
insurance such as Medicaid), (4) have at least ten new preg-
nant women per month on avera ge (i.e., enough patient
flow to run ROSE), and (5) agree to study procedures.
Given the need for prevention of PPD among low-income
women, the study addresses ROSE implementation to
clinics serving mainly low income women; however, any
woman within the clinic can receive ROSE.
Research design
Implementation interventions
Except for one in-person training in HICF, meetings and
trainings take place by videoconference or telephone.
Trainings and meetings for each clinic will be recorded
and provided for optional later viewing.
EIAU consists of initial training and problem-solving
plus planning for sustainment and covers the pre-
implementation step of the REP framework (Fig. 1). Step
1 study investigators will meet with key clinical and op-
erational staff. This 2-h meeting will include (1) a brief
clinical and operational overview of ROSE, (2) problem-
solving and discussion around adaptable elements of
ROSE, and (3) planning and tools for sustainment. This
collaborative process will mesh the clinic ’s context,
needs (including needs of patient population), and re-
sources, with discussion of ROSE core and adaptable el-
ements, resulting in a written, tailored implementation
and sustainment plan that identifies who within the
clinic is responsible for what. Step 2 will consist of twoTable 3 Pilot data: Clinic ratings of need for implementation

separate video meetings. The first videoconference
(60–90 min) will include operational staff to discuss
operational issues (such as reimbursement, identifica-
tion and referral procedures, and identification of
suitable providers). The second videoconference will
consist of a live 4-h training for providers on how to
conduct ROSE. Providers will be given a manual with
the ROSE program, patient handouts, a summary of
key components, scripts for presenting ROSE to pa-
tients, and a customized description of the clinic ’s
logistics for ROSE. Because training sessions are re-
corded and there is a written, clinic-specific sustain-
ment plan, it is possible for clinics to replenish staff
turnover, but turnover may create risk of not sustain-
ing, which would be addressed in LICF or HICF.
LICF will include EIAU plus low-intensity coaching and
feedback, consisting of three components. The first com-
ponent includes one clinical and one operational tele-
phone “booster ”meeting quarterly for additional support
(up to 1 h each). Meetings will identify challenges to con-
ducting ROSE with fidelity, collaboratively problem solve
solutions, discuss re-customization of delivery if needed,
and develop an action plan to address barriers. Subse-
quent meetings will review implementation progress and
collaboratively make changes to the action plan based on
new data, experiences, and discussion.
The second component of LICF is provision of feedback
to clinical and operational staff during booster meetings
to help guide discussion and planning. Clinical feedback
will include information about their fidelity to core ROSE
elements based on the ROSE session-by-session adher-
ence scale and interview validation (see primary outcome
section). We will also provide information to clinical and
operational staff on any changes in the clinic ’sr a t e so f
PPD for the previous quarter and on challenges or suc-
cesses we detect from survey measures.
Finally, to promote partnership and ownership, clinical
and operational staff from clinics assigned to LICF will be
invited to participate quarterly in collaborative board phone
meetings with study investigators and staff from other study
clinics. Staff from LICF clinics will provide feedback to the
study team about the implementa tion strategies being used,
helpful adaptations to the intervention that preserve core
elements, and ways to address challenges in other clinics.HICF: Clinics in the HICF condition will receive every-
thing that the clinics in LICF receive, but at a higher inten-
sity. Clinical and operational booster meetings, feedback,
and participation in collabor ative board meetings will be
monthly, rather than quarterly. In the month after
randomization to HICF, study investigators will travel to
the clinic to provide an in-person clinical and administra-
tive“booster ”meeting to increase engagement (a proposed
mechanism). The remaining monthly meetings will be by
telephone or videoconference. Study investigators will also
be available to answer questions on an ad-hoc basis.
Characterizing implementation interventions (EIAU, LICF, HICF)
Every implementation encounter (e.g., initial or ongoing
training, collaborative board meetings) will be docu-
mented in an electronic implementation case note and
audio or video recorded. The case note will include en-
counter length, time spent on operational vs. clinical sup-
port, a checklist of implementation strategies used (taken
from Powell et al., 2015) [ 42], a checklist of discussion
topics (e.g., billing options), and free response sections to
describe clinic staff responses. We will review and rate
20% of the recordings to verify/augment the notes.
Randomization
After the baseline assessment, all clinics will receive EIAU
(initial training + tools for sustainment). Clinics that are
determined to be at-risk for operational (defined as no
ROSE intervention in 3 months and none planned) and/
or clinical (defined as less than 75% fidelity to ROSE core
elements) failure to sustain at subsequent assessments up
to 15 months will be randomized to receive additional
support. At the first time period at which a clinic is deter-
mined to be at risk (i.e., at 3, 6, 9, 12, or 15 months), that
clinic will be randomized in a 3.8:1 ratio (Fig. 2) to receive
either (1) the addition of low-intensity (every 3 months)
coaching and feedback (LICF), or (2) no additional imple-
mentation support (EIAU only). If clinics receiving LICF
are still found to be at risk at subsequent monitoring pe-
riods, they will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either (1)
nothing additional (i.e., EIAU + LICF only), or (2)
high-intensity (monthly) coaching and feedback (HICF).
Additional study follow-up interviews will occur at 18, 24,
and 30 months, but no implementation intervention will
Fig. 2 The ROSE Sustainment (ROSES) Study SMART designJohnson et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:115 Page 6 of 12
occur after 18 months. Randomization procedures will
balance trial arms by time (3, 6, 9, 12, or 15 months) and
whether or not the clinic is a FQHC. Figure 2shows the
SMART design.
Statistical power is based on the primary outcome:
percent sustainment of core ROSE elements at each
time point. We start with powering the comparison
created by the second randomization, EIAU+LICF vs.
EIAU+LICF+HICF. For this comparison, the literature
reports a range of effect sizes, with three out of four
most relevant ones [ 43–45] exceeding Cohen ’sd=0 . 4 8 .
Aim 1 analyses include adjustment for the 6-month ver-
sion on the primary outcome (baseline for second
randomization) and repeated measures at 9, 12, 15, 18, 24,
and 30 months. Assuming correlations between pairs of
repeated measures of 0.7 based on past work, n=1 9 p e r
group is needed to detect the target effect size with power
of 0.80 or greater at α= 0.05 in two-tailed tests. Assuming
that two thirds of the clinics would still be at risk after
EIAU + LICF, n= 38 clinics will enter into the second
randomization. Therefore, one third, or n=1 9 c l i n i c s
would be deemed low risk and continue EIAU+LICF.
Moving to the left in Fig. 2to the first randomization, the
EIAU + LICF group will have size n=5 7 a s d e t e r m i n e d
above. The size of the other group in the first
randomization of n= 15 will allow to detect the target ef-
fect size with power of 0.89. After the initial EIAU
period, we expect approximately 80% of clinics to be
at risk [ 45,46]. Therefore, 72 (57 + 15) clinics in the
first randomization will be 80% of the sample. Thus
the initial sample size receiving EIAU will be n= 90.
Assessments will be conducted at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18,
24, and 30 months. Each clinic will identify two people:
the person most involved in ROSE (1) clinical and (2)
operational (e.g., billing and scheduling) functions. We
anticipate two respondents per clinic, but power and
measures are unaffected if they are the same person.
Clinic-level measures will be derived from the surveys
and analyses occur at the clinic level. Respondents will
complete quantitative measures online. Qualitative inter-
views will take place by phone (see Table 4).
We define operational failure to sustain as no ROSE
intervention in 3 months and none planned. We define
clinical failure to sustain as less than adequate fidelity to
ROSE core elements (i.e., an average of < 75% of core el-
ements for each session delivered, as measured by the
ROSE session-by-session adherence scale; see primary
outcome section below). Used in previous ROSE trials
(Table 1), this checklist lists on average eight items (rat-
ing of present/absent) that assess whether key tasks of
each session were completed. Given that ROSE is
scripted, item answers are in yes/no format, and core el-
ements are basic (e.g., yes/no —did interventionist ex-
plain PPD? Did interventionist have group memberspractice communication skills through role plays?); com-
pleting 75% of these for “adequate ”fidelity is reasonable.
Primary outcome
Our primary outcome reflects the effectiveness of each
sustainment step in terms of (a) percent sustainment of
core program elements at each time point and (b) total
length of time any ROSE services were provided, and
length of time they were provided with at least moderate
fidelity to core elements. Statistically, one of these mea-
sures should be the primary outcome; we have chosen
the first because it has repeated measures over time, im-
proving power. ROSE ’s core program elements (Table 2)
will be assessed through the ROSE session-by-session
adherence scale, a self-rated intervention fidelity scale
completed by ROSE interventionists after each session
[28]. The outcome for each time point (i.e., quarter) will
be the mean percent of core elements delivered that
should have been delivered at each ROSE session (mean
[number of core elements delivered/number of core ele-
ments should have been delivered] at each session; zero
if no sessions were completed). Self-reported checklists
of mental health intervention fidelity have shown excel-
lent validity when compared to observer-rated scales
[47–50]. We will validate checklist responses against ex-
pert ratings using qualitative interviews for three ses-
sions per quarter. Using a monthly calendar method [ 51,
52], we will track (1) the total length of time any ROSE
services were provided, and (2) total amount of time
ROSE services were offered with adequate fidelity of
core elements (defined as 75% or more on the ROSE
session-by-session adherence scale averaged across inter-
ventionists and sessions each month).
Secondary outcomes
Health impact (PPD rates over time at each clinic)
Quarterly, we will ask each clinic to report the follow-
ing overall numbers: (1) number of women who should
have come for their 6-week postpartum appointment;
(2) number who came; (3) number that were screened
for PPD; and (4) number who screened positive for
PPD. We will also collect this information for four
quarters (12 months) prior to baseline. We will use
these numbers to calculate PPD rates for each time
period (see below). Although not every woman in the
clinic will receive ROSE, we chose to track overall PPD
rates at each clinic because: (1) the study examines
larger-scale sustainment aimed at clinic-wide (and
eventually population-wide) outcomes; and (2) the
clinic-level outcomes are primary; not consenting indi-
vidual patients makes the needed sample size (90
clinics) feasible. Number of patients enrolled in and
completing ROSE (i.e., reach) [ 1]. Clinics will track theJohnson et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:115 Page 7 of 12
number of: (1) patients who agree to come to ROSE,
(2) patients attending at least one session, and (3) pa-
tients attending at least three of the five sessions. Clinic
size (number of new pregnant patients per quarter) and
estimated percent of clinic patients on public assistance
will be considered in analyses.
Return on investment We will analyze four cost-
effectiveness outcome measures: (1) a primary clinical
outcome and number of PPD cases averted, estimated as
the change in PPD rate at the clinic (post-pre)*(clinic ’s
caseload); (2) another clinical outcome and number of
quality-adjusted life years saved, computed from the
primary outcome using Morrell et al. ’s[24]m o d e l ;( 3 )
an implementation process outcome and number of
clients served with fidelity; and (4) a sustainment out-
come and months of additional service delivery. Our
grant accounting will captu re our costs to provide
EIAU, LICF, and HICF. Clinic costs to receive EIAU,
LICF, and HICF will be assessed using hours that
clinic staff spent on EIAU, LICF, or HICF; associated
direct costs (e.g., printing) and staff salaries; and
fringe benefits and overheads. In addition to assessing
the cost-effectiveness of EIAU, LICF, and HICF, we
will also assess the cost-effectiveness of ROSE itself.We will track ROSE delivery costs at each clinic for
one pay period (i.e, 2 weeks) using a time sheet for
staff who spend time on ROSE to record their ROSE-
related hours, work hours on other programs, residual
personal overhead hours, and training time.
Proposed mechanism 1: Clinical and organizational
capacity to deliver ROSE The primary measure will be
the organizational capacity subscale of the Program Sus-
tainability Assessment Tool [ 38,53]. Secondary measures
include number of people trained who have time to de-
liver ROSE and perceiving the clinic as able to manage
space/scheduling and to bill/get reimbursed for ROSE.
Proposed mechanism 2: Ownership and engagement
by clinic staff Ownership and engagement by clinic staff
will be assessed using the sum of other relevant sub-
scales of the Program Sustainability Assessment Tool
(primary): communications, partnerships, political sup-
port, and strategic planning [ 38,53]. The Staff section of
the National Health Service ’s Sustainability Model and
Guide [ 54,55] and investment in addressing PPD will be
secondary measures.
We will assess predictors and processes to provide infor-
mation about which kinds o f sites need which level ofTable 4 ROSES Study schedule of assessments

sustainment support. Organizational context will be
assessed using Aarons ’implementation climate assessment
[56,57]. State policy context will be assessed through two
measures: (1) Enacted state legislation about PPD (0 = no
state enacted state legislation related to PPD, 1 = aware-
ness-related PPD legislation, 2 = legislation mandating PPD
education and services, 3 = legislation with money attached
for PPD education/services); and (2) state-level maternal
mortality [ 58,59].
Processes of implementatio n and sustainment efforts will
be documented using qualitati ve interviews and implemen-
tation case notes. Timing: We will record the dates of
EIAU, LICF, and HICF interventions and dates of any
change in ROSE status (i.e., ROSE offered, not offered, and
ROSE offered with fidelity vs. not) to examine the temporal
relationships among these events. Respondent perceptions
of critical incidents to sustainment success or failure will be
assessed using qualitative interviews.
Analyses
Clinic is the unit of randomization and analysis. Primary
analyses will be intent-to-treat. All statistical tests will be
two-sided with α= 0.05 for sustainment of core program
elements (primary) and health impact (secondary) out-
comes, specified a priori. In exploratory analyses, false
discovery rate due to multiple tests will be controlled
using the Hochberg adjustment [ 60,61].
Baseline comparisons, regression techniques, and
missingness Outcome values at baseline, minimization
variables, and clinic characteristics will be compared using t
tests, chi-square test, or Fisher ’s exact test. If systematic dif-
ferences are found, they will be considered as covariates in
further analyses. Since analyses will control for baseline
values of outcomes, the extent to which other factors may
affect post-randomization outcomes will be reflected in the
baseline version. The regression techniques described
below allow for missing at random mechanisms [ 62]. If pat-
terns of missing data indicate not missing at random mech-
anisms, then models describing missing mechanisms will
be considered (e.g., pattern-mixture models) [ 63,64], and
sensitivity analyses will be employed to investigate the ro-
bustness of the results.
Specific Aim 1a, hypothesis 1: Among clinics determined
to be at risk after EIAU + LICF, those randomized to re-
ceive HICF will have better percent sustainment of core
program elements at post-randomization assessments than
those randomized to continue EIAU + LICF alone. Hypoth-
esis 2: Among clinics at risk after EIAU, those randomized
to EIAU + LICF in the first randomization will have better
percent sustainment of core program elements at post-
randomization time points than those randomized to con-
tinue EIAU alone. Hypotheses will be tested using general-
ized linear mixed effects (GLME) models with sevenrepeated measures for the first randomization and six for
the second. Outcome value at 3 months for the first
randomization (after the initial EIAU), and at 6 months for
the second one (after the initial EIAU+LICF), will be en-
tered as covariates in the respective analyses. Time will be
entered as a class variable to model potentially non-linear
patterns. The test of the equality of the coefficient for the
randomized condition to zero in the GLME model will
yield the test for the main (time-averaged) effect of each
step-up intervention. To expl ore any changing intervention
effect as time progresses, time by randomized condition
interaction will be added to the model. Specific Aim 1b will
use an approach similar to Aim 1a.
Specific Aim 1c: We will use an incremental cost-
effectiveness analysis, showin g cost-effectiveness ratios for
E I A U ,f o ra d d i n gL I C F ,a n df o ra d d i n gH I C F .T h ec o s t -
effectiveness ratio equals ΔC/ΔE, where ΔCi st h ed i f f e r -
ence in costs as LICF and HICF are added, and ΔEi st h e
difference in the outcome measure. We will bootstrap 95%
confidence intervals around the cost-effectiveness ratio and
conduct sensitivity analyses.
Specific Aim 1d: Mechanisms of effects of LICF, HICF.
Randomized condition will be treated as the independent
variable, and hypothesized mechanisms (primary measures
of capacity and engagement/ow nership) will be treated as
potential mediators (one at a time). Effects of mediators on
outcomes will be tested by adding them to the GLMEs de-
scribed above. We will use a bias corrected bootstrapping
analytic strategy [ 65,66]t oe s t i m a t ec o n f i d e n c ei n t e r v a l s
around the indirect effect of randomized condition on the
outcome, through the mediator. To establish mediation,
the 95% confidence interval must not include zero.
Specific Aim 2a explores which kinds of clinics need
EIAU, LICF, or HICF and when for optimal sustain-
ment. Characteristics of clinics found to be at risk at
each assessment will be compared to those of clinics
found to be not at risk using ttests, chi-square test, or
Fisher ’s exact test. Clinic characteristics (size, percent
on public assistance, yes/no FQHC), organizational
context (implementation climate assessment score),
state policy context (rating of state PPD legislation),
and hypothesized mechanisms (capacity and engage-
ment/ownership assessed using Program Sustainability
Assessment Tool subscale scores) will be considered as
potential tailoring variables in defining optimal inter-
vention sequences. The optimal decision rule will be
formulated to specify best first and second intervention
stage following the initial administration of EIAU. For
example, a decision rule might be if a clinic is FQHC,
s t a r tw i t hL I C Fa n di ff o u n dt ob ea tr i s ka t1 2 +
months, step up to HICF, but if found at risk at 6 or
9 months, give LICF more time. The analysis approach
follows the optimization method called Q-learning [ 67–
70]with backward induction [ 71–73].Johnson et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:115 Page 9 of 12
Specific Aim 2b examines implementation processes,
their timing relative to desired outcomes, and critical inci-
dents in order to explore additional factors related to sus-
tainment, as well as dose-response and active ingredients.
For quantitative analyses, w ithin each intervention se-
quence (i.e., EIAU only, EIAU + LICF, and EIAU + LICF +
HICF), we will use the GLME technique to relate repeated
measures of sustainment outcomes to time and the follow-
ing time-varying covariates for each time period: interven-
tion dose, count/frequency of specific implementation
techniques, ROSE status and occurrence of critical inci-
dents. The same model will be fit for mediators, and then
also for outcomes controlling for hypothesized mediators
as time-varying covariates.
Qualitative data will include (1) interviews with clinic
respondents to capture variation in sustainment and risk
and (2) analysis of implementation process notes. Quali-
tative interviews will occur every 6 months after baseline
(at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 months) with ~ 60 interviews (clin-
ical and operational respondents at 30 clinics) at each
time point. At each time point, clinics will be chosen in
the following order: (1) any clinic randomized during
the time period, (2) any clinic that changed status (from
offering ROSE at adequate fidelity to not, or vice versa),
and (3) a few clinics that have sustained well. Deductive
codes will be drawn from interview question topics and
the Critical Incident Technique specified by Pluye [ 74]
to identify critical incidents and processes related to sus-
tainment. Inductive codes capturing emergent themes
will arise from team-level review of the transcripts.
Codes will be entered into NVivo. Thematic analysis
[75] will be used to identify key themes.
Discussion
The ROSE Sustainment Study will be among the first
randomized trials evaluating the costs and cost-
effectiveness (i.e., ROI) of a stepped approach to sustain-
ment, a critical unanswered question in implementation
science. Rigor and reproducibility are ensured by the
randomized trial design; clear inclusion criteria for partici-
pating clinics; manualized prot ocols and fidelity assessment
for EIAU, LICF, and HICF; careful characterization of
implementation processes; reliable and valid measures; and
transparent power and stati stical analyses. The study ’sf o c u s
on enhancing care of an underserved population, examin-
ation of mechanisms and moderators, and ROI analyses
increase its relevance. Thus, the study will advance imple-
mentation science, knowledge of implementation science
mechanisms, and clinical care for at-risk women.
