Objective: Although health cognitions are regarded as key determinants for health behavior change, they
are rarely studied from a dynamic perspective, evaluating the impact of changes in cognitions on changesin behavior. In the present study, we examine how changes in phase-specific and generic healthcognitions influence first, the adoption of exercise and later, the maintenance of the newly acquiredbehavior. Methods: Participants were middle-aged, Finnish adults participating in a lifestyle intervention
to prevent Type 2 diabetes ( N/H11005389). Health cognitions and exercise were measured at baseline
(preintervention) and twice after a lifestyle intervention took place (at 3 months and after 1 year).Results: The results show that both phase-specific and generic health cognitions changed during the
intervention. However, these changes were most pronounced within those participants who started at alower level to begin with. Most important, evidence for the dynamic interplay between changes in healthcognitions and health behavior was observed: Phase-specific health cognitions facilitated the adoption aswell as the maintenance of behavior changes. Conclusions: Thus, health cognitions are amenable to
change, and these changes are adaptive in terms of initiating and maintaining health behavior change.This has implications both for practical intervention research, as well as for theory development.

Unhealthy behaviors are the greatest global public health chal-
lenges of the 21st century. More specifically, physical inactivityand unhealthy diet have been identified as key risk factors forconditions such as obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular dis-eases, and cancer, which together are responsible for 85% ofdeaths and 70% of the disease burden in the European Region(World Health Organization, 2002). Recognizing the unique op-portunity that exists to substantially reduce deaths and the burdenof disease on a population level by improving health behaviors,psychologists have sought to better understand the processes un-derlying individuals’ health behavior.
Generic and Phase-Specific Health Cognitions During
Behavior Adoption and Maintenance
Psychological determinants for the adoption and maintenance of
health-promoting behaviors have mainly been identified within asocial–cognitive framework. Continuum models such as the The-
ory of Planned of Behavior (Ajzen, 1991) commonly assume thatindividuals can be located along a continuum reflecting the like-lihood of action predicted by a specific set of health cognitions,such as self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and intentions(Renner & Schwarzer, 2003; Schwarzer, 2008; see also Connor,2008, and Velicer & Prochaska, 2008, for a discussion). Contin-uum models imply that the influence of health cognitions (e.g.,self-efficacy, Bandura, 1997) is consistent across the behaviorchange process including initiation and maintenance (see Roth-man, 2000). Accordingly, health cognitions operate in a “generic”
way. In particular, affective and emotional obstacles such as feelinganxious or depressed can arise independent of the behavior changephase, and lack of self-efficacy in overcoming these obstacles canendanger the behavior adoption as well as the behavior maintenancephase. Similarly, lack of social support or social pressure can chal-lenge the course of behavior change in any phase. McAuley (1992,1993) called such generic self-efficacy beliefs “barrier” self-efficacyand showed that it is predictive of physical activity in the adoptionphase (during intervention at 3 months) and the maintenance phase (4months’ postintervention; see also McAuley, Jerome, Elavsky, Mar-quez, & Ramsey, 2003). More recently, Blanchard et al. (2007)observed in a longitudinal intervention study that barrier self-efficacywas a significant mediator of physical activity across different mea-surement points in time. Further supporting this notion, studies haveshown that as barrier self-efficacy improved, eating habits also im-proved and weight loss was greater (Roach et al., 2003; Warziski,Sereika, Styn, Music, & Burke, 2008).

Stage models such as the Transtheoretical Model of Stages of
Change (TTM; Prochaska & DiClemente, 1983) or the Health Ac-
tion Process Approach (HAPA; Schwarzer, 2008) conceptualizehealth behavior change as a process that unfolds in qualitativelydifferent stages implying that the impact of health cognitions isphase-specific rather than generic. Accordingly, the psycholog-ical factors underlying the initiation of a change in behavior aredifferent from those that underlie the process of maintainingsuccessfully enacted changes (e.g., Baldwin et al., 2006; Con-nor, 2008; McAuley et al., 2011; Rothman, 2000; Schwarzer,2008). For example, the HAPA model proposes that differentself-efficacy cognitions play different roles depending on thestage of the behavior change process (Schwarzer, 2008;Schwarzer & Renner, 2000, see also McAuley, 1992; McAuleyet al., 2011). Specifically, in the motivational phase, peopleneed to be confident in their capability to set ambitious goalsand to take initiative to become physically active (“actionself-efficacy”; Schwarzer & Renner, 2000; Schwarzer, 2008;see also “motivational self-efficacy”; Schwarzer et al., 2007).Conversely, they need to be confident in keeping the behaviorup when facing obstacles during the maintenance phase, orwhen resuming after a setback (“coping self-efficacy,” Renner& Schwarzer, 2003; Schwarzer & Renner, 2000; see also“maintenance self-efficacy,” Luszczynska & Sutton, 2006 or“recovery self-efficacy,” Schwarzer et al., 2007; cf. also “ad-herence self-efficacy,” McAuley, Lox, & Duncan, 1993). In linewith this contention, research has shown that “action self-efficacy” facilitates the motivational phase where people de-velop an intention to change, whereas “coping self-efficacy”mainly impacts the maintenance phase where they already act,but have to struggle with the maintenance of the behaviorchange (Gutie ´rrez-Don ˜a, Lippke, Renner, Kwon, & Schwarzer,
2009; Renner et al., 2008; Renner, Spivak, Kwon, & Schwarzer,2007; Schwarzer & Renner, 2000; cf., also McAuley et al.,1993; Rodgers, Hall, Blanchard, McAuley, & Munroe, 2002).In a similar vein, a distinction has been made between “actionplanning” and “coping planning.” “Action planning” facilitatesthe translation of intentions into action by specifying specificsituation parameters (“when,” “where”) and a sequence of ac-tion (“how”) during the behavior adoption phase. “Copingplanning” includes the anticipation of barriers and the genera-tion of alternative behaviors to overcome them during behaviormaintenance phase (Schwarzer, 2008; Sniehotta, Scholz, &Schwarzer, 2006; Sniehotta, Schwarzer, Scholz, & Schu ¨z,
2005).
It is interesting to note that previous studies commonly conceptu-
alize and assess health cognitions such as self-efficacy beliefs as beingeither phase-specific or generic. However, one could argue that thetwo types, generic and phase-specific health cognitions do not nec-essarily exclude each other. Accordingly, both types of conceptual-izations might be valid and contribute to explaining health behaviorchange. To address the question of the relative impact of generic andphase-specific health cognitions, both types need to be examinedsimultaneously in the course of the behavior change processes.
From a Static to a Dynamic View on Behavior Change
Beside these conceptual differences between continuum and
stage health behavior models, most empirical approaches haveexamined health behavior as a rather static phenomenon (cf.,
McAuley, 1993; Reuter et al., 2010; Scholz, Keller, & Perren,2009; see Rhodes & Pfaeffli, 2010, and Velicer & Prohaska, 2008,for a discussion). Numerous previous empirical studies basicallyfocused on determining which variables differentiate between peo-ple who display a certain health behavior and people who refrainfrom it. These cross-sectional studies commonly show that self-efficacy is associated with health behaviors (Figure 1). For exam-ple, Booth, Owen, Baumann, Clavisi, and Leslie (2000) showedthat physically active respondents had a higher barrier self-efficacycompared with inactive respondents. Other studies have consid-ered prospective associations between health cognitions measuredat a first point in time and behaviors measured at a second point intime (Figure 1b). However, studies such as these fail to assess anychanges in behavior. Hence, the results obtained are inconclusiveto whether a positive association between cognitions and behaviorreflects a causal relationship. More advanced prospective modelslook at the change in behavior over time (e.g., changes in physicalactivity either at the mean-level or in the rank order) and whetherthis change can be predicted by previously measured health cog-nitions (Figure 1c). Baldwin et al. (2006) for example reported thatself-efficacy measured 2 months after the end of an 8-week smok-ing cessation program (SCP) predicted cessation 7 months laterand that self-efficacy measured at 9 months after SCP predictedcessation 6 months later. It is important to note that this is still onlya semidynamic perspective because only health behavior changesacross time are assessed, whereas the predictors of the behaviorchanges remain static. This applies also for analyses specifyinghealth cognitions as mediators of subsequent behavior changes(e.g., Hallam & Petosa, 2004). Thus, such prospective behaviorstudies show us that people who begin with high self-efficacy aremore likely to change their behavior afterward than people whobegin with low self-efficacy.
However, to understand what actually drives behavior changes,
we need to adopt a dynamic perspective and to study whetherchanges in predictors are followed by changes in behaviors (Rho-des & Pfaeffli, 2010; Velicer & Prochaska, 2008). Thus, psycho-
logical change entailing changes in beliefs and attitudes and be-
havioral change entailing changes in actual behavior need to be
conceptualized as dynamic processes; whereby, behavior changesshould be preceded by psychological changes (Figure 1d). Forexample, an increase in one’s perceived capacity to become phys-ically active (action self-efficacy) should play an important role inprompting behavior initiation. Likewise, an increase in actionplanning should be followed by a higher behavior adoption ratebecause action planning facilitates the transition from intention toaction (Renner et al., 2008; Reuter et al., 2010; Scholz et al., 2009;Schwarzer, 2008). Focusing on the maintenance phase, an increasein coping self-efficacy and coping planning should be associatedwith successful maintenance of behavior change (Sniehotta et al.,2006).
However, changes in cognitions and behaviors might be
empirically difficult to separate from each other because inreality people might not show a marked change in healthcognitions followed by a marked behavior change, but mightshow small changes in cognitions and behavior which con-stantly feedback upon each other instead. Thus, it may be moreappropriate to conceptualize psychological changes as eitheraccompanying or preceding behavioral changes. In both cases,307 DYNAMIC PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGES

it indicates a dynamic process. Moreover, if changes in cogni-
tions are predictive for behavior change, cross-sectionally mea-sured cognitions should not contribute significantly to the pre-diction of behavior change.
Taken together, we assume that from both a theoretical and a
practical view, adaptive changes in psychological determinants areof crucial importance to behavior adoption and maintenance. How-ever, while a wealth of studies have examined the impact ofattitudes and beliefs on behavior changes, the aspect of adaptivechanges of generic and phase-specific health cognitions and theirimpact on the adoption and maintenance of health behavior hasbeen comparably neglected so far.
The Present Study
The current study examines psychological changes and their
subsequent impact on exercise changes and maintenance amongoverweight adults participating in a lifestyle counseling interven-tion to prevent Type 2 diabetes (Absetz et al., 2007). The inter-vention aimed specifically at health cognitions, that is, it promotedself-efficacy and planning of the “when,” “where,” and “how” ofspecific behavior changes including increasing exercise. Hence, it
provides an opportunity to examine health cognition changes and
behavioral initiation over time from a dynamic perspective. Fur-thermore, follow-up measures extending to 12 months allow forexamining adaptive changes that might explain successful main-tenance of the behavior, and thereby extend the classical behavioradoption phase by a behavior maintenance phase (Rothman, 2000).
The aims of the present study were twofold: (1) In a first step,
we tested whether initial health cognitions (action self-efficacy andaction planning) as well as generic health cognitions (barrierself-efficacy) were positively related to health behavior adoptionin order to replicate previous cross-sectional findings. We thentook a dynamic perspective and tested whether adaptive changes inthese phase-specific cognitions were related to the adoption of a
novel behavior. Specifically, it was tested (a) whether changes inaction self-efficacy and action planning, health cognitions relatedto the behavior adoption phase, enabled the initiation of behaviorchange, and (b) whether generic health cognitions (barrier self-efficacy) contribute exploratory power above and beyond thesetwo phase-specific health cognitions.

(2) In a second step we tested whether adaptive changes in
phase-specific health cognitions related to the maintenance of the
newly acquired behavior (coping self-efficacy, coping planning)and generic health cognitions (barrier self-efficacy) predicted theactual maintenance of the newly acquired behavior. The mainte-nance of a behavior is commonly defined as an action sustainedover a certain period of time (Rothman, 2000) such as 12 monthsas in the present study. To examine the question whether adaptivechanges in cognitions were related to the maintenance of the newlyacquired behavior, maintenance analyses were focused on thoseparticipants who had been inactive at baseline but who had becomeactive at the second measurement point, 3 months later. Whenthese exercise adopters maintained their exercise level over 12months, they were classified as “maintainers.” In contrast, if theyshowed a relapse between month 3 and month 12, they wereclassified as “relapsers.”
Method
Study Design and Procedure
The present study was part of the GOAL program (Good Ageing
in Lathi region, Ikihyva ¨P a¨ija¨t-Ha¨me) aimed at improving diet
behavior, physical activity, and reducing obesity, objectives shownto be effective in delaying and preventing the onset of Type 2diabetes (Tuomilehto et al., 2001). The study realized a prospec-tive longitudinal design with a (preintervention) baseline (T1)measurement, and two follow-up measurements at 3 months (T2)and 12 months (T3). Questionnaires assessing health cognitionswere conducted at T1 and T2, and physical exercise was measuredat T1, T2, and T3.The intervention was delivered as group coun-seling with an intensive period of five fortnightly sessions betweenT1 and T2, and a booster session at 8 months. The sessionstargeted participants’ self-efficacy and planning skills for theadoption and maintenance of a healthy diet and physical activityusing theory-driven techniques such as modeling, reattribution ofprevious experiences, verbal feedback, goal-setting, self-monitoring, and planning (for a detailed description of programcontent, objectives, sample, and design, see Absetz et al., 2007;Hankonen, Absetz, Renner, Ghisletta, & Uutela, 2010; Uutela etal., 2004). A vast majority of the participants attended all sixcounseling sessions ( N/H11005327, 84%).
Participants
In total, 389 participants (73% women) aged 50–65 years who
were assessed as having an elevated Type 2 diabetes risk asindicated by the FINDRISC score (Lindstrom & Tuomilehto,2003) were recruited at nurses’ appointments in the primary healthcare centers in Pa ¨ija¨t-Ha¨me province, Finland. Exclusion criteria
were mental health problem or substance abuse likely to interferewith participation, acute cancer, and myocardial infarction duringthe past 6 months. At the baseline, 95.5% of the participants wereoverweight or obese. Four participants had to be excluded fromanalyses because they did not fill in the baseline questionnaire(T1). Attrition rate from baseline (T1) to the first follow-up mea-surement was 5% (T2, N/H11005365) and 15% (T3, N/H11005325) to the
second.Participants provided written informed consent, and were
treated according to American Psychological Association ethicalstandards. Moreover, the ethical commission in Pa ¨ija¨t-Ha¨me hos-
pital district and the Ethical Committee of the National PublicHealth Institute (now National Institute for Health and Welfare)approved the project.
Measures
Self-efficacy for physical exercise. Self-efficacy for physical
exercise was assessed by nine items in accordance to Schwarzerand Renner (2000; cf., also Hallam & Petosa, 2004; McAuley,1992; McAuley et al., 2011; Schwarzer, 2008). The item lead-inwas “In the following, we have listed different factors that mightmake it difficult to exercise on a regular basis. How certain are youthat you could overcome the following barriers?” followed by theitem stem “I am confident that I will engage in regular physicalexercise . . .” and by the nine items detailing typical barriers thatmay hinder the behavior. In particular, action self-efficacy was
measured with two-items (“. . . even if I have to make a detailedplan; . . . even if I have to rethink my entire way of exercising.”),Cronbach’s alpha at T1 /H11005.92 and T2 /H11005.86.Coping self-efficacy
was assessed with three items (“. . . even if I have to try severaltimes until it works; . . . even if I need a long time to develop thenecessary routines; . . . even if didn’t get much support from othersin my first attempts”), Cronbach’s alpha at T1 /H11005.90 and T2 /H11005.88.
Barriers self-efficacy was measured with four items (“. . . even
when I have worries and problems; . . . even when I feel depressed;. . . even when I feel tense; . . . even when I am tired”), Cronbach’salpha at T1 /H11005.94 and T2 /H11005.94. All answers were given on a
4-point rating scale (1 /H11005completely disagree and 4/H11005completely
agree ).
Planning. Planning was assessed according to Sniehotta et al.
(2005) and responses were given on a 4-point rating scale with 1 /H11005
completely disagree to 4/H11005completely agree . Specifically, action
planning was measured with four items (e.g., “I have made a
detailed plan regarding when to exercise”), Cronbach’s alpha atT1/H11005.94 and T2 /H11005.95. C oping planning was assessed with four
items (e.g., “I have made a detailed plan regarding what to do ifsomething interferes with my plans”), Cronbach’s alpha at T1 /H11005
.92 and T2 /H11005.91.
For all four types of health cognitions, action self-efficacy,
coping self-efficacy barriers self-efficacy, action planning, andcoping planning, measurement was comparable across time pointsindicated by invariance probed by confirmatory factor analysis(CFA). The percentage of participants at ceiling which could notfurther increase their self-efficacy or planning at T1 was between4% (action planning) and 15% (coping self-efficacy). FollowingRandolph’s (2007) definition for a substantial ceiling effect with1.645
/H11569SD/H11001M/H110224, shows that all five independent variables
were below the value of 4 supporting the notion that ceiling effects
were not substantial in the present data.
The outcome measure, physical activity includes all moderate-
to-vigorous PA that the participants engage in their leisure timesuch as gymnastics, ball games, and jogging, but none of thetypically low intensity physical activities such as commuting orhousehold chores. Specifically, exercise was measured as averageminutes per day, monitored over a 1-week period, with every 10min of activity recorded in a diary at T1, T2, and T3. For data309 DYNAMIC PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGES

analyses, the daily PA reports were summed up over 7 days in
order to form a weekly PA measure. When studying exercisemaintenance, a cut-off point of 60 min per week was used. Weused moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA because it increases themagnitude of weight loss and results in greater reduction of fastingserum glucose than lower intensity exercise (Shaw, Gennat,O’Rourke, & Del Mar, 2006). Compared with self-report ques-tionnaires, daily PA diaries commonly demonstrate a lower recallbias and thus, an enhanced reliability and validity (Wilcox &Ainsworth, 2009).
Statistical Analysis
The few previous studies examining changes in health cogni-
tions and health behavior have commonly used a Baron and Kennymediation approach (e.g., Napolitano et al., 2008; see also Rhodes& Pfaeffli, 2010), which unfortunately has the disadvantage of agreater influence on measurement errors and the lack of differen-tiation between mean-level changes and interindividual differencesin intraindividual change.
In order to examine the relation between change in health
cognitions and changes in behaviors, we used Multiple LatentChange Score Modeling (MLCSM; McArdle, 2009). MLCSMallows for separating baseline scores from change scores andcorrects for measurement errors in both types of scores. Thus,specifying changes on the level of latent factors has the advantageof representing absolute change on the level of error-free common
scores (McArdle, 2009). By doing so, the problem of typically lowreliabilities of difference scores is circumvented. Moreover, thelatent change model provides estimates of latent change variancecomponents. Statistically significant variances in changes indicatethe existence of interindividual differences in intraindividualchange. This suggests that participants profited to different degreesfrom the intervention for example, they did not increase self-efficacy to the same degree. Second, the change model also pro-
vides covariance estimates between change factors. These covari-ances are the basis for specifying directed effects across changefactors.
Statistical analyses were conducted with Mplus 5.1 (Muthe ´n &
Muthe ´n, 2007). Missing data were handled by the Full Information
Maximum Likelihood algorithm which allows for unbiased param-eter estimates and maximizing data availability (Graham, 2009).
To examine the first study question, whether changes in initial
health cognitions (action self-efficacy and action planning) as wellas generic health cognitions (barrier self-efficacy) were positivelyrelated the adoption of exercise, three factors were specified in the
MLCSM for each of the three health cognition: (a) a latent baselinefactor at T1, (b) a latent baseline factor at T2, and (c) a LatentChange Score capturing the change in the respective health cog-nition between T1 and T2 (Figure 1d and Figure 2). The SEMmodels estimated the mean as well as the variance of the baseline

and change scores. Because the change across time is likely to
depend on the initial baseline level, the baseline and change scoreswere allowed to correlate. Exercise was measured through onevariable and was therefore specified as a manifest variable in themodel. In total, three different MLCSM were tested predictingexercise initiation . In Model 1, the dynamic psychological change-
behavior change perspective was tested assuming that changes inhealth cognitions predict changes in behavior. Accordingly,changes in action self-efficacy ,barrier self-efficacy , and action
planning should be related to change in exercise (Figure 1d and
Figure 2). Next, Model 1 was compared with less comprehensivemodels to test whether the changes in health cognitions signifi-cantly contributed to a better data fit and explanation of theobserved changes in exercise . Model 2 was used to test whether
generic cognitions contribute beyond and above phase-specifichealth cognitions. Therefore, the impact of changes in barrierself-efficacy on change in exercise was set to zero. Model 3 testedwhether changes in phase specific health cognitions— action self-
efficacy andaction planning— significantly facilitated change in
exercise . Thus, these two paths were set to zero in Model 3.
The model’s adjustment is evaluated on the basis of the /H9273
2index
and its degrees of freedom ( df), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI),
and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). ACFI/H110220.95 and a RMSEA /H110210.08 are indicative of a good fit
between the model and the data. The /H9273
2index allows for compar -
ing the three models (Model 1 /H110023) that are nested, meaning that
two alternative models that only differ in a set of parameters,estimated in one model but set to zero (hence not estimated) in theother, can be judged against each other to evaluate which best fitsthe data. If the /H9273
2difference test, comparing two nested models,
yields a nonsignificant result, the model with fewer parameters
and, respectively, more degrees of freedom, is judged to fit the databetter than the other model. In all models, all covariances betweenT1 levels and change scores were allowed to be estimated, and inall factors, the residual variances were allowed to be correlated.
To examine the second study question, whether adaptive
changes in cognitions were related to the maintenance of the newly
acquired behavior, analyses were focused on those participantswho positively changed their behavior during the first threemonths. Accordingly, only participants who had been inactive atbaseline T1 (less than 60 min of exercise per week) but who hadbecame active at the second measurement point at T2 (at least 60min of exercise per week) were included in these analyses. Whenthese exercise adopters maintained their exercise level over 12months till T3, they were classified as “maintainers.” In contrast,if they showed a relapse between T2 and T3 they were classifiedas “relapsers.” For analyzing this smaller subsample, MultipleLatent Change Score Modeling was conducted and additionally,repeated measures analyses of variance using composite scores forcoping self-efficacy, barriers self-efficacy, and coping planning.
Results
A Dynamic Change Perspective on Behavior Initiation:
Does Psychological Change Predict BehavioralChange?
At T1, before the participants had received any counseling, the
expected positive correlations between phase-specific health cog-nitions and exercise emerged: Participants who displayed higher
action self-efficacy ( r/H11005.24,p/H11021.001) and action planning ( r/H11005
.26,p/H11021.001) also demonstrated higher rates of exercise. Like-
wise, a positive correlation between the generic barrier self-efficacy and exercise ( r/H11005.22, p/H11021.001) was observed. After
replicating previous cross-sectional findings, the question emerges(a) whether changes in action self-efficacy, action planning, andbarrier self-efficacy occurred; (b) whether these psychologicalchanges predict changes in exercise initiation; and (c) whetherboth changes in generic and in phase specific self-efficacy beliefswere both important predictors of changes in exercise.
Psychological changes. During the first 3 months of the
intervention, the mean level of action self-efficacy did not change
when adjusted for unreliability. Specifically, the mean of the latentchange score (LCS) between action self-efficacy measured at T1and T2 is .04 and not significant (raw scale scores at T1, M/H110053.0,
SD/H11005.49 and at T2 M/H110053.0,SD/H11005.55). However, the variance
of the latent change score for action self-efficacy is significant(.27, p/H11021.001), indicating change heterogeneity in the amount of
change in action self-efficacy within the sample. Thus, participantsshowed interindividual differences in intraindividual change intheir action self-efficacy. Accordingly, the analyses show a signif-icant correlation between action self-efficacy at T1 and the latentchange score for action self-efficacy measured at T1 and T2 ( /H11002.41,
p/H11021001). Thus, participants who had started with a lower level of
action self-efficacy profited more from the intervention andshowed a higher amount of positive change in action self-efficacythan participants who had a comparably high action self-efficacylevel to start with (cf., Figure 2).
The mean level of barriers self-efficacy increased significantly
during the intervention with a latent change score of .09 ( p/H11021.01)
(raw scale scores at T1, M/H110052.8,SD/H11005.63 and at T2 M/H110052.9,
SD/H11005.66). However, the degree of change in barriers self-efficacy
observed showed marked heterogeneity, as indicated by the sig-nificant variance of the latent change score (variance of the LCSbarrier self-efficacy /H11005.37,p/H11021.001). Again, participants with a
lower baseline level of barriers self-efficacy experienced largerincreases over time (correlation of T1 level and LCS /H11002.43,p/H11021
.001).
Action planning also showed a significant increase from T1 to
T2 with a mean latent change score of .27 ( p/H11021.001) (raw scale
scores at T1, M/H110052.4,SD/H11005.72 and at T2 M/H110052.7,SD/H11005.69).
Similarly to the observed changes in action and barrier self-efficacy, a substantial heterogeneity in the amount of change inaction planning occurred (variance of the LCS action planning /H11005
.57, p/H11021.001). Participants who started at a comparably lower
level of planning showed the greatest changes over time as indi-cated by the significant correlation between T1 level and LCS(/H11002.57,p/H11021001).
Effect of psychological changes on changes in behavior.
During the first three months of the intervention, the mean level ofexercise did not change significantly. Specifically, the mean of thechange score (LCS) between exercise measured at T1 and T2 was3.7, and is not significant ( Mat T1/H1100568.6 minutes per week, SD/H11005
104.9; Mat T2/H1100572.2 minutes per week, SD/H11005111.7). However,
the variance of the change score of exercise is significant (varianceof the LCS exercise /H1100517,233.854, p/H11021.001), indicating substan-
tial heterogeneity in the amount of change in exercise within thesample. Thus, participants changed their exercise level to different311 DYNAMIC PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGES

degrees. Accordingly, the analyses shows a significant correlation
between exercise at T1 and the change score for exercise measuredat T1 and T2 ( /H11002.54,p/H11021001). It is important to note that the power
of variance in change is particularly low, especially when there arefewer than 4 repeated measures. Thus, the observed significantvariance in exercise change with only two repeated measuresindicates that the underlying effect size of the variance in changein exercise is quite strong (Hertzog, von Oertzen, Ghisletta, &Lindenberger, 2008).
In the next step, we analyzed whether changes in action self-
efficacy, action planning, and barrier self-efficacy predictedchanges in exercise.
Model 1 assumed that changes in all three health cognitions
predict changes in exercise behavior. Statistically this equates to anestimation of the regression coefficient between the latent changescore of the respective health cognition and changes in the indi-vidual exercise behavior. Thus, Model 1 estimates the regressioncoefficient for (a) phase-specific action self-efficacy, (b) genericbarrier self-efficacy, and (c) phase-specific action planning onbehavior changes. The Model Fit Indices indicate a satisfactory Fitto the data with CFI /H11005.97, TLI /H11005.96, and RMESA /H110050.05 and
a/H9273
2of (195) /H11005421.53, p/H11021.001 (cf. also Figure 2).
In Model 2, the regression coefficient between changes in the
(generic) barrier self-efficacy and changes in behavior was set tozero. This more parsimonious model did lead to a comparablygood model fit (CFI /H11005.97, TLI /H11005.96, and RMESA /H110050.05 and
a/H9273
2of (196) /H11005422.85, p/H11021.001). The chi-square difference test
indicates no significant change in the model fit, /H92732(1)/H110051.32, ns.
Thus, Model 2 suggests that only changes in health cognitions
tailored to the behavior initiation phase, namely changes in actionself-efficacy and in action planning, facilitated an increase inexercise behavior, whereas changes in generic health cognitionsdid not lead to a change in exercise behavior.
Model 3 was even more restrictive, also assuming that changes
in the two phase specific health cognitions (action self-efficacy,action planning) were unrelated to changes in behavior. Hence, inthis model, all three regression paths were set to zero. Model 3shows a significant increase in the /H9273
2value, with /H92732(1)/H1100518.1,
p/H11021.001, in comparison to less restrictive Model 2, indicating a
deterioration in the fit to the data (CFI /H11005.96, TLI /H11005.96, and
RMESA /H110050.06 and a /H92732of (198) /H11005440.95, p/H11021.001).
Thus, the /H92732difference tests indicate that Model 2 fit the data
best, confirming that changes in action self-efficacy and in action
planning were significantly and positively associated with changes
in exercise behavior. However, changes in the generic barriersself-efficacy did not contribute over and above phase-specificself-efficacy beliefs to the prediction of changes in exercise.
Maintenance of a Newly Acquired Behavior
After establishing that changes in action self-efficacy and action
planning facilitated changes in the initiation of exercise behavior,the question arises whether changes in health cognitions alsopromote maintenance of the newly acquired behavior. Assumingthat a change in health cognitions induced through the interventionwas crucial for determining whether people maintained the newlyacquired behavior or relapsed into inactivity, implies (a) thatmaintainers and relapsers did not differ at the beginning of theintervention in terms of maintenance specific health cognitionssuch as coping self-efficacy and coping planning, and that (b)
maintainers experienced a greater level of change in maintenancespecific health cognitions than relapsers during the intervention.To analyze whether changes in maintenance specific health cog-nitions facilitated the maintenance of the newly acquired behavior,we identified participants who had been inactive at T1 but whobecame active during the intervention to T2. As a cut-off, we used60 min per week of exercise. Altogether 58 participants fulfilledthese criteria. Of these, 31 participants maintained their lifestylechange ( /H1135060 min per week), and 27 participants relapsed ( /H1102160
min per week) at T3.
The results show that at T1, relapsers and maintainers did not
differ significantly in their mean levels of coping self-efficacy(M/H110053.09, SD/H11005.45 vs. M/H110053.05, SD/H11005.56), coping planning
(M/H110052.24, SD/H11005.75 vs. M/H110051.97, SD/H11005.77), or barriers
self-efficacy ( M/H110052.71, SD/H11005.56 vs. M/H110052.65, SD/H11005.72; all
ps/H11022.20).
MLCSM analyses that estimated multiple-group models for
changes in health cognitions between T1 and T2 indicated thatcoping self-efficacy increased significantly within maintainers(mean LCS /H11005.28, p/H11021.001). Conversely, relapsers did not
significantly change their coping self-efficacy between T1 and T2(mean LCS /H11005.09, ns). Thus, participants who were able to
maintain their levels of exercise increased their self-efficacy inovercoming obstacles associated with the maintenance of the be-havior change during the intervention period to a significantlygreater degree than those who relapsed. Moreover, maintainersshowed a significant latent change score for coping planning(mean LCS /H11005.51,p/H11021.01), whereas relapsers showed no signif-
icant change (mean LCS /H11005.20, ns.). Similarly, for the generic
cognition barrier self-efficacy, maintainers showed a significant
increase (mean LCS /H11005.14, p/H11005.03), whereas for relapsers no
significant change was observed (mean LCS /H11005.05,ns).
Discussion
Why do people adopt health behaviors? This has been the key
question of health psychology research over the past decades.Accordingly, the core attention has been paid to motivationalprocesses, tackling the question how people change from a state ofno interest in changing their behaviors to having decided to makea change. Recent theoretical models and empirical studies broad-ened this motivational view by including volitional processes,thereby extending the classical question of why people adopthealth behavior to the question of how they maintain the behaviorchange. Thus, not only the initiation of a behavior change, but alsothe maintenance of these changes has gradually started receivingattention (Rothman, 2000).
Stage models assume that the initiation and maintenance phase
are guided by different psychological factors (Lippke, Ziegelmann,Velicer, & Schwarzer, 2009; Prochaska & DiClemente, 1983;Reuter et al., 2010; Scholz et al., 2009; Schwarzer, 2008), whereasother conceptualizations assume more generic factors which maybe equally influential in both phases (cf., Blanchard et al., 2007;Rothman, 2000). However, despite this shift to conceptualizing thesuccessful adoption of health behavior as a dynamic process thatunfolds over time, most empirical approaches have examinedhealth behavior change as a rather static phenomenon. Commonly,static predictors (e.g., self-efficacy at T1) are used to predict312 RENNER, HANKONEN, GHISLETTA, AND ABSETZ

changes in behavior (e.g., change in exercise behavior between T1
and T2). We argue that we need to focus on changes in psycho-logical factors preceding changes in behavior to understandchanges in behavior. In the present study, we attempted to modelwhether changes in health cognitions facilitate the initiation andmaintenance of health behavior. Specifically, we hypothesized thatchanges in action self-efficacy and action planning would becritical determinants for the adoption of physical exercise, andafter people have been physically active for a significant period oftime, the maintenance of their active lifestyle would be guided bycoping self-efficacy and coping planning. Moreover, we wereinterested in whether generic health cognitions (barrier self-efficacy) contribute explanatory power over and above phase-specific health cognitions (action and coping self-efficacy/planning).
Psychological Change: Between-Person Differences in
Within-Person Changes
When taking a dynamic perspective on health behavior change,
the first necessary step is to demonstrate significant changes in thepsychological predictors. This raises the question of whichchanges are meaningful? Change is most often defined as a mean-level change, which refers to whether most people change in thesame way during a specific time period. However, it appears moreappropriate to assume ‘between-person differences in within-person changes” (Nesselroade & Baltes, 1979) because interven-tions are more likely to induce greater changes in those partici-pants who exhibited a lower level of self-efficacy and planning tobegin with. By modeling latent change scores (cf., McArdle,2009), it is possible to estimate and test not only the classical meanof the changes, but also the variance of the changes and thecovariance of the initial scores with the changes. Our results showthat the observed mean level changes across time in self-efficacybeliefs and planning were only small in absolute size; thus, a“normative” change was not observed. However, it is important tonote that this does not imply that the intervention was unsuccessfuland the behavior changes were not related to psychologicalchanges. It only signifies that the observed changes did not followa generalizable pattern that applies to all participants. Furtheranalysis shows significant variances of the latent change scores,indicating that participants who started with a lower level of actionself-efficacy, barrier self-efficacy, or action planning profitedmore from the intervention and showed a higher amount of posi-tive psychological change than participants who had a comparablyhigh level to start with. This might also offer an explanation forprevious studies that suggest an insignificant role for self-efficacybeliefs (e.g., Napolitano et al., 2008). Moreover, relations betweenthe baseline level and the changes in psychological factors such asself-efficacy with health behavior changes may coexist in the samelongitudinal study and may overlap to some extent. In a prospec-tive study on exercise and diet behavior change, Maibach, Flora,and Nass (1991) found a negative relation between baseline self-efficacy and subsequent self-efficacy change similar to the presentstudy. However, subsequent behavior change was predicted byboth the baseline level and changes in self-efficacy, given that bothwere included in the model as predictors whereby baseline self-efficacy alone was not predictive of subsequent behavior changes.Maibach et al. (1991) concluded that to prevent changes in self-efficacy suppressing the relationship between baseline self-
efficacy and subsequent behavior change, the inclusion of bothstatic and dynamic constructs is necessary for a full account of theimpact of self-efficacy (cf., also Reuter et al., 2010; Scholz et al.,2009). However, from a conceptual and practical point of view theimpact of the changes in psychological factors appears to be moresignificant.
Psychological Change and Behavior Change
Our findings provide evidence that changes in health cognitions
are predictive for the adoption and maintenance of health behavior.Regarding the influence of changes in action self-efficacy andaction planning on the initiation of exercise behavior, the datashow that changes in both positively predicted the uptake of anactive lifestyle. It is interesting to note that change in genericself-efficacy did not facilitate the initiation of exercise behavior.Turning to the maintenance phase, the data show that those par-ticipants who managed to maintain their newly acquired exercisebehavior showed a significantly greater change in coping self-efficacy and coping planning than those who resumed their previ-ous, sedentary lifestyle. Moreover, a similar pattern was observedfor generic self-efficacy: Maintainers showed a greater changethan relapsers. Thus, stage models differentiating between a qual-itatively different motivational and volitional phase receive un-equivocal support from the present data.
One might argue that the results, or rather the lack of results for
the generic “barrier” self-efficacy across the behavioral changephases, provide even more support for the notion that psycholog-ical factors exert their influence in a phase-specific way. Becausebarrier self-efficacy did change, in comparison to the two phase-specific self-efficacy beliefs through the intervention, but onlyexerted a significant influence within the maintenance phase, onecould argue that it actually represents a phase specific rather thana generic psychological factor.
Moreover, the present results point to an important implication
for measuring the impact of psychological factors, in particularself-efficacy, on behavior changes. For example, Baldwin et al.(2006) reported that preceding self-efficacy levels were only pre-dictive of behavior initiation but not behavior maintenance. Con-versely, Williams et al. (2008) reported that self-efficacy levelsonly predicted the maintenance but not the adoption of a behavior.Accordingly, both argued that self-efficacy, although a criticaldeterminant of people’s behavioral practices, may only be ofsignificance in a specific phase of the behavior change process.The puzzling aspect is, however, that the effectiveness is suggestedfor different phases in the behavior change process. Moreover, inthe present study, self-efficacy was predictive for both the initia-tion and maintenance phase, thereby raising the question: How canthese inconsistencies reconciled? Similarly to the present study,both Baldwin et al. (2006) and Williams et al. (2008) assessed theinitiation and maintenance of behavior and self-efficacy at differ-ent time points. However, the crucial difference between the threestudies is that both earlier studies assessed the same form ofself-efficacy at various time points, hence, self-efficacy was op-erationalized in a phase-insensitive way that assumes a genericinfluence of the self-efficacy measure. In contrast, in the presentstudy, self-efficacy was measured in a phase-sensitive way thatassumes that different types of self-efficacy play roles in specific313 DYNAMIC PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGES

phases; this was supported by the data. Thus, the inconsistencies
between the different findings may be the result of phase-insensitive versus phase-sensitive operationalizations of self-efficacy beliefs. Supporting this notion, the generic, non phase-
specific measure barrier self-efficacy, was not predictive for thedifferent phases, but only for on specific phase. This matchesthe results of the previous study. It is interesting to note that theself-efficacy measure used by Williams et al. (2008) tapped intoovercoming similar obstacles as those included in the present barrierself-efficacy measure—for example, being in a bad mood or feelingtired—and their findings confirmed that this type of self-efficacypredicts maintenance of behavior change. Considering the presentresults, changes in self-efficacy appear to play a crucial role in anyphase of the behavior change process but the type of self-efficacywhich is of influence, changes in a phase-specific way.
Limitations of the Present Study
The prospective, longitudinal design, with its relatively long
follow-up and cognitive–behavioral intervention targeting keycognitions, provided a unique opportunity to analyze the dynamicsof cognition and behavior change. The measurement modelsshowed that the health cognition measures were reliable within andacross time, thereby reducing biased estimations effects. However,the observed changes in the health cognitions may reflect ceilingeffects and hence, an underestimation of the intervention effect forparticipants who begin with a high self-efficacy. Because theproportion of participants at ceiling (4% to 15%) was rather lowand below the 20% recommend by Wang, Zhang, McArdle, andSalthouse (2008), biased estimations may not be very likely butcannot be ruled out completely. Exercise behavior assessment wasbased on a composite score encompassing 1-week of physicalactivity self-monitoring sheets, which may inevitably be accom-panied by self-reporting biases. Although the approach used forstatistical modeling in the present study has several advantagesover more traditional alternatives, a randomized controlled designwould have been stronger for establishing the intervention effectson health cognitions. While our study on the interplay betweenadaptive psychological changes and behavior changes focused onself-efficacy and planning, other constructs may possibly followsuch logic. The present constructs build on an increasingly solidevidence-base (Schwarzer, 2008) who were also main the targetsof our intervention (Absetz et al., 2007). Other health-relatedcognitions such as subjective norms or risk perceptions are alsolikely to show adaptive changes that could translate into behaviorchange (Renner & Schupp, 2011). In future studies, it would befruitful to examine these also from a dynamic perspective.
Conclusions
Health cognitions are amenable to change, and these changes are
adaptive—that is, they are accompanied or followed by behaviorchanges. In order to gain a deeper insight in the underlying processof health behavior change, we suggest adopting a dynamic per-spective not only on the behavioral outcome, but also on thepsychological predictors. In addition, studying both generic andphase-specific constructs and adaptive changes for different typesof behavior in different phases of behavior change might substan-tially contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of theunderlying mechanisms and to the success in efforts to promote
sustainable behavior changes.
