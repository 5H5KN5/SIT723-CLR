Abstract
Background: Dating and relationship violence (DRV) —intimate partner violence during
adolescence —encompasses physical, sexual and emotional abuse. DRV is associated with a range of adverse health
outcomes including injuries, sexually transmitted infections, adolescent pregnancy and mental health issues.
Experiencing DRV also predicts both victimisation and perpetration of partner violence in adulthood.
Prevention targeting early adolescence is important because this is when dating behaviours begin, behavioural
norms become established and DRV starts to manifest. Despite high rates of DRV victimisation in England, from 22
to 48% among girls and 12 to 27% among boys ages 14 –17 who report intimate relationships, no RCTs of DRV
prevention programmes have taken place in the UK. Informed by two school-based interventions that have shown
promising results in RCTs in the USA —Safe Dates and Shifting Boundaries —Project Respect aims to optimise and
pilot a DRV prevention programme for secondary schools in England.
Methods: Design: optimisation and pilot cluster RCT. Trial will inc lude a process evaluation and assess the feasibility of
conducting a phase III RCT with embedded economic evaluation. Cognitive interviewing will inform survey development.
Participants: optimisation involves four schools and pilot RCT involves six (four intervention, two control). All are
secondary schools in England. Baseline surveys conducted with students in years 8 and 9 (ages 12 –14). Follow-up surveys
conducted with the same cohort, 16 months post-baseline. Optimisation sessions to inform intervention and research
methods will involve consultations with stakeholders, including young people.
Intervention: school staff training, including gui dance on reviewing school policies and addressing ‘hotspots ’for DRV and
gender-based harassment; information fo r parents; informing students of a help-seeking app; and a classroom curriculum
for students in years 9 and 10, including a student-led campaign.
Primary outcome: the primary outcome of the pilot RCT will be whether progression to a phase III RCT is justified. Testing
within the pilot will also determine which of two existing scales is optimal for assessing DRV victimisation and
perpetration in a phase III RCT.

Background
Dating violence and public health
Dating and relationship violence (DRV) —used to
describe intimate partner violence during adolescence
[1–3]—encompasses threats, emotional abuse, control-
ling behaviours, physical violence and coerced,
non-consensual or abusive sexual activities perpetrated
by a partner [ 4]. Globally, 30% of ever-partnered women
report violence from current or previous partners at
some point in their lives [ 5,6]. Evidence suggests that
partner violence begins early, with prevalence of DRV
victimisation already reaching 29.4% among girls ages
15–19 [ 6–10]. Norms accepting of gender-based vio-
lence and harassment strongly correlate with DRV per-
petration and victimisation [ 9–13] and young people
identify concerns about social repercussions as a barrier
to intervening in DRV as a bystander [ 14]. Young people
who experience DRV are more likely to be victims or
perpetrators of relationship violence as adults [ 15–17].
Early experience of DRV is also associated with subse-
quent adverse outcomes such as substance misuse and
anti-social behaviour [ 18–20], sexually transmitted infec-
tions (STIs) and teenage pregnancy [ 21], eating disorders
[17], suicidal behaviours and other mental health prob-
lems [ 17,22], physical injuries [ 23] and low educational
attainment [ 22]. Experiencing violence during pregnancy
correlates with poorer maternal and neonatal health out-
comes [ 21,24]. In addition to its harms, domestic vio-
lence is associated with significant financial costs to
health systems. In 2008 in the UK, it was estimated that
domestic violence cost the National Health Service
£1.73 billion per year with total costs to the UK econ-
omy of £15.73 billion per year [ 25].
Rationale for proposed study
There is a pressing need to prevent DRV in the UK.
Recent surveys of English young people suggest
victimisation prevalence of 22 –48% for young women
and 12 –27% for young men aged 14 –17 years who re-
port an intimate relationship [ 26–28]. Universal, primary
prevention of DRV is required since these behaviours
are widespread and under-reported [ 29]. Prevention dur-
ing early adolescence is important because this is the
time when dating behaviours begin, behavioural norms
become established and DRV starts to manifest [ 30,31].Schools are a key site to achieve this since they are
settings in which young people are socialised into
gender norms and in which significant amounts of
gender-based harassment and DRV go unchallenged
[32,33]. Because DRV arises not only from individual
deficits in communication and anger management
skills [ 34] but also from sexist gender norms and per-
vasive gender-based harassment [ 23,35–37], within
schools multi-component interventions —for example,
addressing school curricula, policies and environ-
ments —are required [ 38] to address factors driving
DRV at multiple levels of the social ecology.
There is thus a pressing need for a UK-based
randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a universal
multi-component, school-based prevention intervention,
informed by existing evidence, which targets early ado-
lescents. Project Respect aims to meet this need. The
Project Respect intervention is designed to address simi-
lar topics to those targeted by the effective Safe Dates
[39] and Shifting Boundaries interventions [ 40]. The
programme ’s theory of change outlines hypothesised
pathways to programme outcomes. There is a need for a
UK-specific intervention because given cultural differ-
ences, direct replication of a US intervention is unlikely
to be effective in the UK [ 41]. We will therefore begin
by working with UK secondary school staff and students
to elaborate and optimise the intervention and produce
the manual, curriculum and other intervention materials.
We will then subject Project Respect to a pilot cluster
RCT to assess feasibility and acceptability and optimise
methods prior to a phase III RCT. This will be the first
UK RCT of an intervention to prevent DRV among
young people.
Interventions
Guidance on domestic violence published by the UK Na-
tional Institute for Health and Care Excellence in 2014
has highlighted the lack of current evidence for interven-
tions preventing adolescent DRV [ 42]. Recent Cochrane
and Campbell reviews of DRV prevention have con-
ducted meta-analyses to estimate effects on behavioural,
attitudinal and knowledge outcomes, finding overall
effects on knowledge and attitude, but not behaviour
[43,44]. However, more promising results for behaviour
are reported from RCTs of the Safe Dates and ShiftingMeiksin et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:13 Page 2 of 17
Boundaries interventions [ 39,40]. These were included in
the Campbell but excluded from the Cochrane review; ex-
clusion of Safe Dates and Shifting Boundaries from the
Cochrane review was due to incomplete reporting and re-
cent publication respectively. The authors of the Cochrane
review noted that non-inclusion of Safe Dates was a major
limitation of their review. These interventions were also
identified in a broader review of interventions to prevent
sexual violence perpetration as the only effective interven-
tions addressing this issue among young people [ 45].
The Safe Dates curriculum was delivered over ten ses-
sions to eighth and ninth grade students (aged 13 –15 years)
in North Carolina, USA and focused on the consequences
of DRV, gender roles, conflict management skills, norms,
help-seeking and student participation in drama and poster
activities. A school cluster RCT [ 39,46]r e p o r t e ds i g n i f i -
cantly reduced perpetration of physical DRV and victimisa-
tion of serious physical DRV ( p< 0.05 for both) and
significantly reduced perpetration and victimisation of sex-
ual DRV ( p= 0.04, p= 0.01 respectively) at 4-year
follow-up. The duration of these effects suggests these
might be real behavioural effects rather than merely social
desirability effects on reporting. The intervention was
equally effective for females and males [ 47].
A four-arm school cluster RCT of the Shifting Bound-
aries interventions allocated schools to receive one of
the following: curriculum intervention, school environ-
ment intervention, combined intervention and neither
intervention [ 40]. The curriculum comprised six sessions
on the consequences of DRV, the social construction of
gender roles and what constitutes healthy relationships.
The environment intervention included higher levels of
staff presence in hot-spots for gender-based harassment
mapped by students, including use of joint faculty and
student safety committees to help guide the placement
of security personal, posters and increased sanctions for
perpetrators including use of building-based temporary
restraining orders and use of joint faculty-student safety
committees. The environment-only and the combined
interventions were effective in reducing sexual violence
victimisation at 6-months follow-up (respectively OR =
0.662 p= 0.028; OR = 0.659 p= 0.011). There were also
reductions in sexual violence perpetration in the
environment-only and combined intervention (respect-
ively OR = 0.527 p= 0.002; OR = 0.524 p= 0.001). There
w a sn oe v i d e n c eo ft h e s ee f f e c t sw i t ht h ec u r r i c u l u m -
only intervention. Results show similar benefits for fe-
males and males and for those with and without a his-
tory of DRV [ 48]. The Cochrane review recommended
that further research on multi-component interventions
in schools is a priority. The Campbell review recom-
mended that future interventions more explicitly ad-
dress skills and the role of peer norms in preventing
DRV.Benefits and risks
There are major potential public health benefits arising
from the prevention of adolescent DRV, which affects a
substantial proportion of young people in the UK. Com-
ponents of the Project Respect intervention are similar
to those comprising the effective Safe Dates and Shifting
Boundaries interventions, which do not report physical
or psychological harm stemming from such an interven-
tion blending structural and curriculum components.
Evidence suggests DRV research is unlikely to pose psy-
chological risks to research participants [ 49]. Research
participants will be informed that their participation in
the research is voluntary and that they may withdraw at
any point. As we cannot be certain prior to piloting that
this intervention research poses no risk to participants,
our process evaluation will explore potential for harm.
Any potential mechanisms of harmful effects of the
intervention will be explored through qualitative data in
this pilot RCT and in later evaluation phases. We will
closely liaise with participating schools to facilitate data
collection with students. We will minimise disruption
for staff and ensure student privacy and confidentiality
both by employing strategies used successfully in our
past work, such as having the trial manager liaise dir-
ectly with each participating school to identify conveni-
ent times and places for data collection, and by piloting
innovative methods in this context, such as the use of
computer assisted self-interview (CASI) surveys. Ethical
issues are discussed in more detail below.
Methods
Research aims, research questions and objectives
Aims
I. With stakeholders, to elaborate and optimise
Project Respect, informed by existing research.
II. To conduct a pilot RCT (four intervention, two
control schools) in southern England.
Research questions
1. Is progression to a phase III RCT justified in terms
of pre-specified criteria? These criteria are: random-
isation occurs and four or more schools out of six
accept randomisation and continue within the
study; the intervention is implemented with fidelity
in at least three of the four intervention schools; the
process evaluation indicates the intervention is ac-
ceptable to 70% or more of year 9 and 10 students
and staff involved in implementation; CASI surveys
of students are acceptable and achieve response
rates of at least 80% in four or more schools; and
methods for economic evaluation in a phase III
RCT are feasible.Meiksin et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:13 Page 3 of 17
2. Which of two existing scales —the Safe Dates (SD)
and the short Conflict in Adolescent Dating
Relationships Inventory (CADRI-s) —is optimal for
assessing DRV victimisation and perpetration as
primary outcomes in a phase III RCT, judged in
terms of completion, inter-item reliability and fit?
3. What are likely response rates in a phase III RCT?
4. Do the estimates of prevalence and intra-cluster
correlation coefficient (ICC) of DRV derived from
the literature look similar to those found in the UK
so that they may inform a sample size calculation
for a phase III RCT?
5. Are secondary outcome and covariate measures
reliable and what refinements are suggested?
6. What refinements to the intervention are suggested
by the process evaluation?
7. What do qualitative data suggest about how
contextual factors might influence implementation,
receipt or mechanisms of action?
8. Do qualitative data suggest any potential harms and
how might these be reduced?
9. What sexual health and violence-related activities
occur in and around control schools?
Objectives
a. To elaborate and optimise Project Respect and
produce intervention materials in collaboration with
the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children (NSPCC), four secondary schools, youth
and policy stakeholders and the originators of
effective US programmes informing our intervention.
b. To adapt and cognitively test the SD and CADRI-s
scales prior to piloting.
c. To recruit six schools, undertake baseline CASI
survey of two cohorts of students at the end of years
8 and 9 respectively plus online staff survey, and
randomise four schools to receive the intervention
and two to be usual-treatment controls (see Fig. 1).
d. To ensure Project Respect is implemented for
students in years 9 and 10, conduct process
evaluation, and follow-up student CASI and staff
online surveys 16 months post-baseline (start of
years 10 and 11).
e. To address the above research questions to inform
progression to a phase III RCT.
Research design
Intervention elaboration and optimisation and cognitive
interviewing to refine DRV scales
The core components of the intervention and the under-
lying theory of change have been informed by existing
research, including studies on the Safe Dates and Shift-
ing Boundaries interventions and existing systematicreviews as described above. Further work is required to
elaborate the intervention methods and produce mate-
rials (manual, staff training and student curriculum),
optimising these for use in the UK. This process will be
led by the investigators and NSPCC working in close
collaboration, and with the participation of students and
teachers drawn from four secondary schools (different to
those that will be involved in the pilot RCT), as well as
the Advice Leading to Public Health Advancement
(ALPHA) group [ 50]—a young people ’s research advis-
ory group —and policy stakeholders. We will elaborate
and optimise the intervention through a systematic
process involving review by researchers and NSPCC of
existing systematic reviews and evaluation reports, elab-
oration of Project Respect methods and production of
draft materials by NSPCC staff and the research team,
consultation with stakeholders on the draft intervention
materials via two facilitated workshops and web-based
consultation and refinement of the draft intervention
materials based on feedback. At the same time, we will
adapt two existing DRV scales and refine the adaptations
by conducting cognitive interviews with young people
who are the same age as intended respondents. In cogni-
tive interviewing, a qualitative method for pre-testing
and improving survey questions, the focus is on the cog-
nitive processes respondents use to answer survey items
[51]. It aims to assess whether survey items are appro-
priate for their intended purpose [ 52], and we will use
this approach to identify problems respondents encoun-
ter with survey items and to assess whether participants
understand these items as intended. After adaptation, we
will test these two scales in the pilot cluster RCT in
order to determine which would be optimal for measur-
ing DRV victimisation and perpetration as the primary
outcomes in a phase III RCT. In these cognitive inter-
views, we will also pre-test selected items on attitudes
and norms related to gender and DRV. Cognitive inter-
viewing will occur in one of the schools taking part in
elaborating the intervention and will involve eight male
and eight female students. Students will complete paper
questionnaires covering basic socio-demographics
followed by the two DRV scales. They will then be inter-
viewed and asked to ‘think aloud ’about how they an-
swered the questions [ 53] with some probing [ 54] about
comprehension, recall, judgement and response in rela-
tion to selected items [ 55].
Pilot RCT
We will then conduct a pilot cluster RCT (four interven-
tion, two control schools; different to those involved in
intervention elaboration and any subsequent phase III
RCT), with an integral process evaluation and an em-
bedded economic evaluation feasibility study. The re-
search and intervention teams will be separatelyMeiksin et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:13 Page 4 of 17
managed to ensure the evaluation is independent and
that the proposed research does not distort intervention
delivery. Although in the phase III RCT the interventionwould be delivered over two academic years (targeting a
single cohort of students progressing from year 9 to year
10 in this period), in this pilot the intervention will beFig. 1 SPIRIT figure for pilot cluster randomised controlled trial of Project RespectMeiksin et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:13 Page 5 of 17
implemented during one school year to two groups of
students, those in year 9 and those in year 10. Curricu-
lum lessons designed for each of these year groups will
be piloted with the appropriate year group. One year of
piloting is sufficient to assess feasibility and acceptability
in order to address our research questions. Similarly, al-
though a future phase III RCT would involve follow-up
surveys at 28 months post-baseline, follow-up surveys in
the pilot RCT will occur 16 months post-baseline. This
timescale is sufficient to assess the feasibility of trial
methods among participants of the same age as partici-
pants would be in a phase III trial at 28 months. Due to
the sensitive nature of the baseline and follow-up stu-
dent surveys, we will use a repeat cross-sectional rather
than longitudinal design. The follow-up surveys will be
conducted with the same two cohorts of students who
took part in the baseline survey, but surveys will not be
linked at the level of the individual. This design does not
require that we link respondent names to the responses
they submit, therefore protecting students ’anonymity.
The Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for
Intervention Trials (SPIRIT) figure (Fig. 1) outlines the
key phases of the study. We provide a SPIRIT checklist
in Additional file 1[56,57].
Setting
The Project Respect intervention is intended for all
mainstream secondary schools. There is no clear evi-
dence that DRV among UK adolescents is associated
with individual socio-economic status (SES) or
school-level deprivation [ 27,58]. Evaluating Project Re-
spect in a sample of schools over-representing those in
deprived areas would therefore unnecessarily undermine
the generalisability of our findings.
Pilot trial inclusion criteria
/C15Secondary schools (including free schools and
academies) in southern England.
Pilot trial exclusion criteria
/C15Private schools, PRUs and schools designed
especially for students with learning disabilities.
Population
As with similar previous studies [ 39,40], Project Respect
is a universal intervention for female and male students
aged 13 –15 years (in years 9 and 10 in UK schools). This
age group is appropriate because this is the time when
most dating behaviours begin, behavioural norms be-
come established and DRV starts to manifest [ 30,31].
Stakeholder consultations suggest provision to year 11
students is not feasible due to UK school examtimetables. In the pilot RCT, the intervention will run for
1 year only, targeting year 9 and 10 students, so that we
may assess the intervention feasibility and acceptability.
Pilot trial inclusion criteria
/C15Students nearing the end of years 8 and 9 at the
time of the baseline survey
Pilot trial exclusion criteria
/C15Students with severe cognitive limitations that
would prevent them from understanding or
consenting to take part in the research will not be
included in the research. No other students in
participating schools will be excluded from the
study. Fieldworkers will support students who have
mild learning difficulties or limited English
proficiency to complete the questionnaire.
Analytic sample and proposed sample size
The pilot RCT will focus on feasibility and no power cal-
culation for this has been performed. Four schools imple-
menting the intervention in the pilot trial balances the
need to assess implementation in a diversity of schools
while ensuring the pilot is small enough to be appropriate
as a preliminary to a larger phase III RCT. The analytic
sample for outcome assessment in the pilot will be a mini-
mum of 1800 students at the ends of years 8 and 9 (aged
12/13 and 13/14 years) at baseline, with follow-up at
16 months. Data on fidelity and acceptability are intended
to provide site-specific descriptive estimates rather than to
be generalizable to a broader group of schools.
Recruitment and randomisation
Four schools will be involved in intervention elaboration
and optimisation, purposively sampled to vary by region
and deprivation (as measured by the income deprivation
affecting children index, IDACI). In the subsequent pilot
RCT phase, three schools in southeast England and
three schools in southwest England will be recruited;
these schools will be different from those participating
in optimisation. Schools taking part in the pilot RCT will
be purposively sampled to ensure variation by
deprivation and school-level value-added academic at-
tainment, as approximate indicators of school capacity
to deliver Project Respect.
We will recruit schools via letters and telephone calls
to schools, local authorities, academy chains and school
networks. Response rates will be recorded, as will any
stated reasons for non-participation. After baseline CASI
surveys with students at the end of years 8 and 9,
schools will be stratified by region and randomly allo-
cated 2:1 to intervention/control by the London SchoolMeiksin et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:13 Page 6 of 17
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) clinical tri-
als unit (CTU). The 2:1 allocation will enable us to pilot
randomisation while ensuring sufficient diversity among
four schools for piloting the intervention. Retention of
control schools will be maximised via £500 payment and
feedback of survey data.
Planned intervention
Intervention components
Project Respect is a manualised, multi-component
school-based universal prevention intervention.
Table 1summarises the Project Respect intervention
according to the items included in the ‘Template for
Intervention Description and Replication ’(TIDieR)
checklist [ 59], and Fig. 2presents the intervention's the-
ory of change.
Research and provider and roles
In close collaboration with the research team, NSPCC
will lead the elaboration and optimisation of the inter-
vention and the production of materials. In the delivery
phase, NSPCC will work independently from the re-
search team to train senior leadership and other key
school staff in safeguarding to prevent, recognise and re-
spond to gender-based harassment and DRV; to enable
them to lead the intervention in their schools; to review
school rules and policies to help prevent and respond to
gender-based harassment and DRV; and to identify and
increase staff presence in ‘hotspots ’for these behaviours.
Trained school staff will then implement the school en-
vironment and curriculum components, cascading train-
ing in safeguarding to all staff.
Comparator
The comparator consists of schools randomly allocated
to the control group. Control schools will not implement
Project Respect, instead continuing with any existing
gender, violence or sexual health-related provision. The
study will include three additional activities to support
all schools taking part: NSPCC will offer safeguarding
officers of all schools a support session to prepare them
in case the school experiences increased numbers of stu-
dents seeking support as a result of the research or
intervention (this will take place before the baseline sur-
veys in case of such an increase immediately following
baseline surveys; the training therefore takes place be-
fore randomisation); the research team will provide a
short report to intervention and control schools about
the prevalence of DRV reported in their schools; and
NSPCC will brief its ‘Childline ’telephone helpline staff
so that they are aware of the project in case the research
or intervention results in students contacting them.
While these activities mean the experience of control
schools will differ slightly from treatment as usual, wefeel this measured response is essential to fulfil our duty
of care to trial participants while not excessively distort-
ing the nature of the comparator. The nature of the
comparator will be assessed by examining the sexual
health education provision in and around control
schools at baseline.
Outcome measures
In the pilot RCT, the primary outcome will be whether
progression to a phase III RCT is justified in terms of the
pre-specified criteria listed in research question 1. The
pilot RCT will also determine which of two existing DRV
scales will be used to measure the primary outcomes of
DRV victimisation and perpetration in a phase III trial.
All measures of primary and secondary outcomes and
mediators that would be examined in a phase III RCT
will also be assessed for reliability in this pilot.
The twin primary outcomes in a phase III RCT would
be binary measures of DRV victimisation and perpetration,
measured using self-reports rather than via routine data.
This is because most experiences of DRV will not result in
notifications to the school, police or NHS [ 43] and our
intervention is likely to increase rates of such notifications
with the risk of ascertainment bias. While our interven-
tion might also result in increased self-reports, this report-
ing bias will be minimised by use of a validated and
reliable measure comprising items focused on specific be-
haviours. As there is currently no clear evidence as to
whether the SD or CADRI-s measure is the optimal scale
to assess DRV victimisation/perpetration in this popula-
tion, we will adapt and test these measures in this pilot to
determine which is most suitable in the UK context.
The SD measure of dating violence is based on
self-reported perpetration and victimisation of psycho-
logical abuse and of physical and sexual violence in the
previous year. Participants are asked ‘How often has
anyone that you have ever been on a date with done the
following things to you? ’Response options range 0 –3,
indicating frequency. Items are summed and then
recoded 0 –3 indicating overall degree of abuse. Psycho-
logical abuse is assessed in terms of 14 acts (Cronbach ’s
alpha = 0.91 for victimisation and 0.89 for perpetration)
[47,60]. Physical and sexual violence are assessed in terms
of 18 acts, of which 6 indicate serious physical violence
and 2 indicate forced sexual acts (Cronbach ’sa l p h a sf o r
perpetration of moderate physical violence = 0.92, for se-
vere physical violence = 0.89 and for sexual violence =
0.86). For victimisation, Cronbach ’s alphas are respectively
0.90, 0.86 and 0.74 [ 47]. The SD measure is one of the
most commonly used in research on adolescent dating
violence [ 61] and correlates with poor mental health and
various health risk behaviours including other forms of
youth violence and substance use [ 23,62,63]. Reliability
has been examined in multiple studies of adolescents, butMeiksin et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:13 Page 7 of 17
Table 1 Description of the Project Respect intervention using TIDieR checklist items
TIDieR Item Information on Project Respect intervention
Brief name Project Respect
Why We present the theory of change for Project Respect in Fig. 2. The intervention is underpinned by the theory of planned
behaviour [ 93] and the social development model [ 94]. It is also supported by reviews which suggest that DRV interventions
should challenge attitudes and perceived norms concerning gender stereotypes and violence as well as support the development
of skills and control over behaviour [ 38]. Informed by the theory of planned behaviour, Project Respect will aim to reduce DRV
by challenging student attitudes and perceived social norms about gender, appropriate behaviour in relationships, and violence;
and by promoting student sense of control over their own behaviour. A key element of our theory of change is that attitudes
and norms will be challenged not only via the student curriculum but also via actions at the level of the school environment to
reduce gender-based harassment observable on the school site and increase school sanctions against gender-based harassment
and DRV. Sense of control over behaviour will be promoted via the curriculum components focusing on communication and
anger management skills. Informed by the social development model, Project Respect will enable student participation in
curriculum lessons and leadership of campaigns in order to maximise learning, increase student bonding to school, and increase
acceptance of school behavioural norms. The curriculum also aims to reduce DRV by promoting awareness of the Circle of 6
app [ 95] and local services, increasing the ability of those who experience DRV to seek support.
Project Respect, like the earlier Shifting Boundaries intervention [ 40], includes a curriculum as well as
school-elements. Informed by Shifting Boundaries, the Project Respect curriculum addresses gender roles and healthy relationships
and uses hotspot mapping to inform changes in staff patrols of school premises. Informed by the earlier Safe Dates intervention [ 96],
which is primarily curriculum-based, the Project Respect curriculum includes a focus on gender roles, conflict management skills,
norms, and help-seeking and incorporates a student-led campaign component.
What
materialsSchools allocated to receive the intervention will be provided with various resources. Schools will receive a manual to guide delivery
of the intervention. School staff will be offered training (see below) and participants will receive slides to guide delivery of an all-staff
training they deliver. Parents of students will be given written information on the intervention and advice on preventing and
responding to DRV. Students will be given the opportunity to download the ‘Circle of 6 ’app which helps individuals contact friends
or the police if threatened by/experiencing DRV. Schools will be provided with written lesson plans and slides to guide delivery of a
classroom social and emotional skills curriculum targeting students aged 13 –15 years which includes a student-led campaign element.
What
proceduresProject Respect is a multi-component school-based universal prevention intervention. The intervention aims to address DRV perpetrated
by young people of all genders in heterosexual or same-sex relationships. School policies and rules will be rewritten to ensure that they
aim to prevent and respond to DRV and gender-based harassment. Areas on the school site that are identified through student and
staff mapping exercises as ‘hotspots ’for DRV and gender-based harassment will be patrolled by staff to prevent and respond
to incidents. Responses will include appropriate sanctions for perpetration, support for victims and referral of victims or perpetrators
to specialist services where necessary.
The curriculum will include lessons that focus on (1) challenging gender norms; (2) defining healthy relationships; (3) inter-personal
boundaries, consent, and mapping ‘hotspots ’for gender-based harassment and DRV on the school site; (4) how students can help a
friend they are worried about, and empowering students to run campaigns challenging gender-based harassment and DRV;
(5) communication and anger management skills relating to relationships; and (6) accessing local services relating to DRV
and reviewing student-led campaign ideas. Learning activities will include: information provision; whole class discussions; video
vignettes to help students identify abusive behaviours and relationships; quizzes; role plays and exercises; and cooperative planning
and review of student-led campaigns. Schools that are randomly allocated to the intervention will be asked to continue with usual
provision in addition to implementing the Project Respect intervention.
Who
providesSchool staff will implement the intervention with support from the NPSCC. Training will be provided by NSPCC for senior leadership
and other key school staff to enable them to plan and deliver the intervention in their schools and review school rules and policies to
help prevent and respond to DRV and gender-based harassment, and increase staff presence in ‘hotspots ’for these behaviours. Training
will then be provided by these trained school staff for all other school staff in safeguarding to prevent, recognise and respond to
gender-based harassment and DRV. The NSPCC will further support intervention delivery by offering advice sessions of up to one hour
per week to intervention schools.
How All intervention components will be delivered face-to-face and at the group level.
Where All components will be delivered on school premises.
When and
how muchTraining by NSPCC will be provided in a 2 –3-h session. Training within the school will be provided in a 60 –90-min session.
Policy review and hotspot mapping will occur in one or more school management meetings. School patrols will occur
throughout the school year. The intervention curriculum will comprise six sessions in year 9 and two booster sessions
for the same cohort in year 10, a relatively small number of lessons both years to ensure that the curriculum can
be implemented in busy school timetables.
As described in the ‘Research design ’section above, lessons in this pilot study will be delivered to students in years 9 and 10
during the same school year rather than to the same cohort over two years.
Tailoring The intervention will not be tailored.
How well
(planned
fidelity
assessment)As described in the ‘Process evaluation ’section below, fidelity will be assessed via audio-recordings of the NSPCC-delivered and all-staff
trainings, logbooks completed by teaching staff delivering curriculum sessions, structured observations of a randomly selected session
per school of one curriculum lesson, interviews with the NSPCC trainer(s) and interviews with intervention school staff.Meiksin et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:13 Page 8 of 17
not in the UK to date. We will add introductory text to
clarify our interest in both on- and off-line behaviours.
Our primary outcome will examine categorical measures
of DRV perpetration and victimisation, while secondary
outcomes will examine each subscale.
The CADRI measure comprises 92 items assessing DRV
victimisation and perpetration over the past year. Sub-
scales cover emotional abuse, relational abuse, controlling
behaviours, physical violence and non-consensual sexual
activities. Items are rated on a 4-point scale according to
frequency, allowing generation of a binary measure of
prevalence or a quantitative measure of frequency created
from the summed score divided by the number of items.
Research has found that DRV as measured via the CADRI
scale is correlated during adolescence with early sexual de-
but, unsafe sex, violence and suicidal ideation [ 64]. The
CADRI instrument has been used in research with young
people in the USA, Canada [ 65,66]a n dS p a i n[ 67], but
not in the UK to date.
The use of the CADRI measure within trials is problem-
atic due to its length. A short 10-item version of the
CADRI, the CADRI-s, has been developed and pilotedamong school-based samples of students in 9th –12th
grade and in at-risk samples in Canada. The new measure
was found to be slightly less sensitive than the full ques-
tionnaire but to have good reliability, fit and convergent
validity with the full measure [ 68]. We plan to further as-
sess this short version. We will modify the scale by adding
text clarifying our interest in both on- and off-line behav-
iours and adding two items from the original CADRI
measure to assess experience of controlling behaviours.
The developers of the SD and CADRI-s have permitted
our use and modification of these measures. We propose
to use the pilot RCT to refine the two existing measures,
cognitively test these to inform further refinements and
then pilot the measures and assess completion rates,
inter-item reliability (using Cronbach ’s and ordinal alphas)
and fit (using confirmatory factor analysis).
Informed by our theory of change, secondary out-
comes in a phase III RCT will include the following,
which we will assess for reliability in this pilot trial:
/C15DRV frequency of victimisation and perpetration
(using the SD and CADRI-s measures).Fig. 2 Theory of change for Project RespectMeiksin et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:13 Page 9 of 17
/C15Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale
(SWEMWBS). This is a 7-item scale designed to
capture a broad concept of positive emotional well-
being including psychological functioning, cognitive-
evaluative dimensions and affective-emotional as-
pects [ 69]. Items are rated on a 5-point scale: none
of the time, rarely, some of the time, often, or all of
the time. Responses are scored and aggregated to
form a ‘well-being index ’with a higher score
representing greater well-being [ 69].
/C15Paediatric quality of life inventory (PedsQL) version
4.0. This is used to assess overall quality of life. The
23-item PedsQL [ 70] has been shown to be a reliable
and valid measure of quality of life in normative ado-
lescent populations. It consists of 23 items repre-
senting 5 functional domains —physical, emotional,
social, school and well-being —and yields a total
score, two summary scores for ‘physical health ’and
‘psychosocial health ’, and three subscale scores for
‘emotional ’,‘social ’and ‘school ’functioning.
/C15Sexual harassment. Two new items measuring
experience of sexual harassment (1) overall and (2)
in school, drawing on a widely accepted definition of
what constitutes sexual harassment [ 71].
/C15Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). This
is a brief, validated instrument for detecting
behavioural, emotional and peer problems and pro-
social strengths in children and adolescents. It com-
prises 25 items across five scales assessing emotional
symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inatten-
tion, peer relationship problems and prosocial
behaviour. A higher total problems score indicates
greater problems [ 72].
/C15Self-reported sexual health. We will examine
pregnancy and unintended pregnancy (initiation of
pregnancy for boys) and sexually transmitted
infections, age of sexual debut, partner numbers, and
use of contraception at first and last sex using
measures from previous RCTs [ 73,74].
/C15Self-reported use of primary care, accident and
emergency, other service in past 12 months.
/C15Self-reported contact with police [ 75].
/C15School attendance and educational attainment via
routine school-level data on half-days absent and
General Certificate of Secondary Education (English
secondary school qualification) performance for the
trial cohorts.
Informed by the intervention ’s theory of change, we
will also examine the following mediators (to be assessed
for reliability in this pilot trial):
/C15Social norms and gender stereotyping. We will use a
modified version of a multi-item subscale developedby Foshee [ 23] measuring acceptance of prescribed
norms (acceptance of dating violence under certain
circumstances) using a 4-point Likert scale format,
and adapt these items to measure injunctive norms
(beliefs about others ’attitudes towards dating vio-
lence). Items are averaged to create a composite
score [ 23]. We will use a modified version of items
used by Cook-Craig et al. to measure descriptive
norms (beliefs about whether DRV is common) [ 76].
We will measure gender stereotyping using a modi-
fied version of the 16-item Attitudes Towards
Women Scale, which has high reliability and uses a
4-point Likert scale format [ 77]. We will adapt these
items to measure injunctive norms (beliefs about
others ’attitudes towards gender stereotypes).
/C15Self-reported awareness of services, and help seeking
for victims and perpetrators. We will assess these via
existing single-item self-report measures [ 23].
/C15Communication and anger management. We will
assess these using the Modified Sexual
Communication Survey (MSCS) and SDQ respectively.
MSCS measures open sexual communication with a
current or potential partner [ 78]. The scale includes 21
eight-point Likert scale items examining frequency and
has excellent reliability [ 79,80].
/C15Dating violence knowledge. This will be measured
using a modified version of a reliable multi-item
scale involving true/false questions on help-seeking
and definitions [ 40].
/C15Downloading and use of the ‘Circle of 6 ’app will be
measured by a new single-item measure.
To ensure student surveys are age-appropriate, items
with sensitive sexual content will be excluded at baseline
but included at 16-month follow-up.
Economic outcome measures
In this pilot study, the aims of the economic evaluation
component are to plan the economic evaluation that
would accompany a phase III RCT, identify sources of
data and determine how best to collect these. We will
undertake a detailed cost analysis of the intervention;
collect resource use data and examine response rates
and data quality; use the process evaluation to identify
any unanticipated costs to students, schools and NSPCC
and to consider ways of maximising responses to eco-
nomic data collection; identify unit costs for the cost
components; and review additional literature to identify
any new potential sources of data to model long-term
costs and outcomes.
In a phase III RCT, the primary economic evaluation
would take the form of a within-trial cost-utility analysis,
with health outcomes expressed in terms of quality-ad-
justed life-years (QALYs). Changes in health-relatedMeiksin et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:13 Page 10 of 17
quality of life would be measured primarily from study
participants ’perspectives with a secondary analysis exam-
ining teacher outcomes. The Child Health Utility (CHU)
9D measure [ 81] would be used to assess students ’
health-related quality of life and the 12-item Short Form
Health Survey (SF-12) would be used for this purpose for
teachers [ 82]. In the pilot RCT, we will assess the mea-
sures used for this analysis by collecting data on them at
baseline and follow-up. The CHU-9 is a validated
age-appropriate measure that was explicitly developed
using children ’s input and has been suggested to be more
appropriate and function better than other generic health
utility measures for children and adolescents [ 83]. In a
phase III RCT, student and teacher utility values would be
collected at baseline and subsequent follow-up points
using the selected measures, which would then be con-
verted into utility scores suitable for calculating QALYs
using published algorithms. In addition, a cost conse-
quence analysis would be presented with further out-
comes. The time horizon would capture costs and
outcomes within the trial. In terms of costs, we would
present the base-case cost-effectiveness estimate from a
public sector perspective, as recommended by the Na-
tional Institute for Health and Care Excellence ’s public
health methods guidance. Given that Project Respect will
be delivered by a charity, our costing perspective would
also be extended to include the voluntary sector.
Assessment and follow up
Baseline surveys will be conducted before randomisation
with two cohorts of students, one nearing the end of
year 8 (aged 12 –13 years) and one nearing the end of
year 9 (aged 13 –14 years). Baseline surveys will collect
data on socio-demographic variables, pre-hypothesised
outcome variables and potential confounders. Where
feasible, surveys will be done at the same time of day in
all schools. Students will be given an information sheet
about the study at least 1 week prior to data collection
and an oral description of the study. Students will have
the opportunity to ask questions before deciding
whether or not to take part. We will be clear about the
topics to be explored and the complete anonymity of
questionnaire data. Students will then be invited to
assent to participate in data collection. All students will
be provided with information about school safeguarding
officers, other local safeguarding resources (where rele-
vant), a national helpline and other agencies for students
experiencing DRV or other forms of abuse. We will also
provide students and their parents/guardians with the
contact details for the research team to report any con-
cerns relating to the research. As is conventional with UK
trials in secondary schools, including trials of sexual health
and violence prevention interventions [ 73,74,84], stu-
dents ’parents/guardians will also be sent a detailedinformation sheet at least 1 week prior to data collection.
They will be asked to contact the school or research team
should they have questions or should they wish for their
child not to take part. A sample of the information sheets
and consent forms used for the study are provided in
Additional file 2.
Given the particularly sensitive nature of DRV, we will
pilot the use of tablet-based CASI surveys to maximise
student privacy and optimise the quality of the data col-
lected. Students will complete surveys confidentially and
anonymously with researchers present to explain data col-
lection and support participants where necessary. Teach-
ing staff will be present but will remain at the front of the
classroom, helping to maintain order but unable to read
student responses. During optimisation, we will ask stu-
dents about the acceptability of this approach.
We will survey absent students by leaving paper ques-
tionnaires and stamped addressed envelopes with their
schools. When we conduct follow-up surveys 16 months
post-baseline, with students who are near the beginning of
years 10 and 11 (aged 14 –15 and 15 –16 years, respect-
ively), we will collect self-report data on intervention
participation, outcomes and potential mediators. Field-
workers will be blind to school allocation. Based on past
experience [ 84], in the pilot, we anticipate 95% baseline
survey participation and 90% at follow-up. We will also
conduct online staff surveys at baseline and 16 months
post-baseline for the economic and process evaluations.
Process evaluation
An integral process evaluation, informed by existing
frameworks [ 85–87], has three purposes: first, to exam-
ine intervention feasibility, fidelity, reach and acceptabil-
ity; second, to assess provision of sexual health services
and violence prevention in and around control schools;
and third, to explore context and potential mechanisms
of action, as well as potential unintended effects, in
order to refine the intervention ’s theory of change and
the intervention methods.
Intervention feasibility, fidelity, reach and acceptability
In addition to assessing the ‘progression criteria ’outlined
in the study ’s research question 1 relating to intervention
feasibility and acceptability, we will also examine reach
and how it varies by student and school characteristics.
Data on these outcomes will be collected via:
audio-recording of all NSPCC and school-delivered train-
ing (fidelity); logbooks completed by teaching staff deliver-
ing all curriculum sessions (feasibility, fidelity, costs);
structured observations of a randomly selected session per
school of one curriculum lesson (fidelity); student surveys
(reach, acceptability); staff survey (reach, acceptability of
training and intervention overall); interviews with the
NSPCC trainer(s) (feasibility, fidelity); interviews with fourMeiksin et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:13 Page 11 of 17
staff per intervention school, purposively sampled by seni-
ority and which intervention component(s) they are in-
volved in (acceptability, fidelity); interviews with two
parents per intervention school, purposively sampled by
age and sex of their child (acceptability); and interviews
with eight students per intervention school, purposively
sampled by year 9/10, sex and involvement in a
student-led campaign as part of the intervention delivery
(acceptability).
Fidelity will be assessed quantitatively against tick-box
quality metrics. For example, each training and curricu-
lum session will be assessed against session-specific
quality metrics relating to the topics covered, the exer-
cises used and opportunities for discussion. After the
intervention is fully elaborated, the investigators will fi-
nalise the fidelity metrics based on the intervention and
will ask the Study Steering Committee (SSC) to approve
these prior to their use in the process evaluation.
Trained researchers will conduct interviews in private
rooms, guided by semi-structured interview guides. Al-
though the qualitative research will not aim to explore
students ’personal experiences of sex, relationships, or
DRV, disclosures of abuse may occur. In focus groups,
we will instruct participants not to disclose any experi-
ences of abuse during the group discussion since we
cannot guarantee that all participants would keep this
information confidential. All focus groups will be con-
ducted by researchers who have been trained to steer
group discussions away from potential disclosures. We
will, however, provide the opportunity for participants to
speak with the researcher in private after the focus
group if they would like help with any issues they are fa-
cing. If disclosures of sexual intercourse before age
13 years or of any other abuse occur during qualitative
data collection, the researcher will establish whether the
reported abuse meets our criteria for referral. If it does,
the researcher will inform the student that she or he
must report this to the school safeguarding officer. We
have defined categories of harm warranting such re-
sponses with the advice of a social worker specialising in
child protection and in collaboration with NSPCC (see
the‘Ethical issues ’section, below). We will consult with
school safeguarding officers in advance to ensure this
process is compatible with school policies.
Interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed in
full. Drawing on May ’s theory of implementation [ 86],
qualitative research will assess how implementation is
influenced by NSPCC and school staffs ’perceptions as
to the intervention ’s potential workability and integra-
tion within the school system, possession of the required
norms and relationships to underpin implementation,
shared commitment to enact the complex intervention
and continuous contributions that are sustained in time
and space.Provision in control schools
We will examine sexual health provision in and around
control schools to describe our comparator. Data on this
will be collected via staff and student surveys; interviews
with two staff members per control school, selected pur-
posively by seniority; and four students per control
school, selected purposively by year 9/10 and sex.
Context and mechanisms of action
Informed by realist approaches [ 88,89], using qualitative
methods we will aim to explore potential intervention
mechanisms and how these interact with contextual fac-
tors to enable outcomes, including mechanisms that
might give rise to unintended, potentially harmful conse-
quences. We will also explore how potential mechanisms
of action might vary with school context and student
characteristics, in order to refine and optimise the inter-
vention ’s theory of change and intervention methods.
Data on context and mechanisms will be collected via
interviews with NSPCC trainers, student and staff sur-
veys and interviews with four staff and eight students
per intervention school (purposively sampled as de-
scribed above). Our quantitative research will pilot me-
diator analyses, as discussed in the next section.
Approach to data analysis
In the pilot RCT, our primary analysis will determine
whether criteria for progression to a phase III RCT are
met. Descriptive statistics on fidelity will draw on
audio-recordings of training, logbooks completed by
teaching staff and structured observations of curriculum
lessons. Acceptability will be assessed through student
and staff surveys. Recruitment and response rates will be
reported in a flow chart and used to refine our power
calculation. Pilot RCT analyses will also assess which of
our indicative primary outcomes is sufficiently reliable
to use within a phase III RCT, assessing response rates,
inter-item reliability (using Cronbach ’s and ordinal al-
phas) and fit (using confirmatory factor analysis). In-line
with our approach in a previous pilot trial, we will pri-
oritise completion rates and inter-item reliability when
judging between measures [ 84]. We will set the thresh-
old for acceptable reliability at a Cronbach ’s alpha of
0.70 or higher. If both measures perform well on this,
we will choose the CADRI-s for use in a phase III RCT
since this is the more established measure. If neither
performs well, we will not progress to phase III without
first identifying and piloting alternative measures.
Although the pilot RCT will be underpowered to de-
termine an ICC and prevalence among the comparator
of DRV, it will enable a more qualitative assessment of
whether estimates derived from North American studies
seem to be appropriate for schools in England.Meiksin et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:13 Page 12 of 17
Data from the process evaluation will be analysed to
describe provision of violence prevention and sexual
health-related activities in and around study schools,
contextual influences on intervention feasibility and ac-
ceptability and potential mechanisms of benefits and un-
intended impacts to refine the intervention ’s theory of
change. Qualitative data will be subject to thematic con-
tent analysis using techniques drawn from grounded
theory such as in vivo/axial codes and constant compari-
son [ 90]. As well as deriving themes inductively from
the data, we will also use realist approaches to evaluation
[89] and May ’s implementation theory [ 86] to inform
analyses, identifying characteristics of the intervention,
providers and settings which promote or hinder imple-
mentation or which might interact with intervention
mechanisms to enable outcomes. Qualitative research
will develop hypotheses which will be tested in explora-
tory quantitative analyses where data allow.
The economic evaluation feasibility component of the
study will pilot measures assessing quality of life and as-
sess the feasibility of methods to be used within a full
RCT. We will also pilot the primary intention-to-treat
analyses of outcomes which will use repeat cross-sectional
data as would be done within a phase III RCT, as well as
secondary, moderator and mediator analyses. In a phase
III RCT, moderator analysis would be conducted to exam-
ine how effects vary by student socioeconomic status, sex
and ethnicity and by school IDACI and value-added aca-
demic attainment. Mediator analysis would examine
whether intervention effects on mediators might explain
effects on our primary outcomes using established
methods [ 91]. All such analyses will be underpowered in
this pilot RCT but will be piloted to refine methods.
Protecting against bias
The aim of this study is to pilot the intervention and RCT
methods, not to estimate intervention effects. However,
we will pilot methods aimed at minimising bias. The re-
search team and the intervention delivery team will be
separately managed. We will aim to maximise response
rates to reduce non-response and attrition bias, for ex-
ample by following up with schools to collect surveys
from those individuals not present during survey sessions.
Response rates and qualitative data will be analysed to re-
fine data collection methods prior to a phase III RCT.
Ethical issues
Ethical approval for the study has been obtained from
the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine
Ethics Committee and the NSPCC Research Ethics
Committee. All work will be carried out in accordance
with guidelines laid down by the Economic and Social
Research Council, the Data Protection Act 1998 and the
latest Directive on Good Clinical Practice (2005/28/EC).Any member of the research/fieldwork team visiting a
school to conduct unsupervised research with a student
will be required to have a full Disclosure and Barring
Services check. Quantitative and qualitative data will be
managed by project staff using secure data management
systems and stored anonymously. Quantitative data will
be managed by LSHTM, an accredited CTU. All data
will be stored in password-protected folders. The names
used in qualitative data will be replaced with pseudo-
nyms in interview transcripts. In reporting the results of
the qualitative research, care will be taken to use quota-
tions that do not reveal the identity of respondents. In
line with Medical Research Council guidance on per-
sonal information in medical research, we will retain all
research data for 20 years after the end of the study [ 92].
This is to allow secondary analyses and further research
to take place, and to allow any queries or concerns about
the conduct of the study to be addressed. In order to
maintain the accessibility of the data, the files will be
refreshed annually and upgraded if required.
Any disclosures of abuse that meet the criteria for a
serious adverse event (SAE) or suspected unexpected
serious adverse reaction (SUSAR; defined as an unex-
pected SAE) will be reported in anonymised form to the
SSC (which, because this is a pilot and not a phase III
RCT, will undertake data monitoring and ethics duties)
and to the LSHTM and NSPCC ethics committees.
Reporting will be in real time if the event might plaus-
ibly have been caused by the intervention or research.
Any other SAEs and SUSARs will be reported to these
committees annually. Reporting will include the type of
event, circumstances, extent of any possible connection
with intervention or research activities and outcome of
the response.
Research governance
Study registration
The pilot RCT has was registered on 8th June 2017 with
the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN 65324176). https://
doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN65324176
Study management
The principal investigator (PI), Chris Bonell (CB), will
have overall responsibility for the conduct of the study.
The day-to-day management of the RCT will be coordi-
nated by Rebecca Meiksin (RM), the study manager
based at LSHTM. The following governance structures
will be instituted: a study executive group (SEG) where
the PI (CB) will chair fortnightly meetings with the study
manager (RM), statistician Elizabeth Allen (EA) and,
where appropriate, CTU and fieldwork staff; a study in-
vestigators ’group (SIG) chaired by CB which includes all
co-investigators and members of the SEG and which will
meet monthly during the early stages of the researchMeiksin et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:13 Page 13 of 17
(months 1 –6), then every 3 months thereafter; and an
SSC which will meet three times throughout the life of
the project to advise on the conduct and progress of the
study and on relevant practice and policy issues. The
SSC will also undertake data monitoring and ethics du-
ties. The project will employ standardised research pro-
tocols and pre-specified progression criteria, which have
been agreed and will be monitored by the SIG and SSC.
Consultation with public and stakeholders
The intervention will be elaborated and optimised by
the NSPCC and the study team working with the
ALPHA young people ’s research advisory group, policy
stakeholders and school staff, as well as with young
people recruited via an organisation that provides sup-
port to survivors of sexual abuse to ensure the interven-
tion and evaluation are sensitive to the needs and
preferences of young people directly affected by DRV.
School staff and young people from the ALPHA group
will also be consulted on research methods at the begin-
ning of the study on recruitment, assent/consent mate-
rials, refinements of DRV scales and survey methods and
strategies for increasing retention; and at the end of the
study on RCT and intervention refinement and know-
ledge transfer. We will also convene two meetings with
policy stakeholders, including representatives from the
Association for Young People ’s Health, the Department
for Education, the Department of Health, Public Health
England, the Personal, Health, Social and Economic
PSHE Association and an organisation providing support
services to survivors of sexual abuse. The meetings will
take place at the start to build support for the study and
ensure it is policy-relevant, and near the end to inform
preparations for a full RCT and knowledge transfer.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this will be the first trial of an inter-
vention that aims to reduce DRV among adolescents in
the UK. Drawing on evidence from existing reviews and
from promising interventions trialled in the USA, and
underpinned by behavioural change theory, the Project
Respect intervention will be optimised for the UK through
work with students, school staff and policy stakeholders.
We will pilot baseline and follow-up CASI surveys, asses-
sing feasibility and acceptability of the research methods
and determining whether the SD or CADRI-s scale is opti-
mal for assessing the primary outcome measures of DRV
perpetration and victimisation in a phase III RCT.
Informed by realist methods, the integral process
evaluation will use qualitative methods to explore poten-
tial intervention mechanisms and how these interact
with contextual factors to elicit both intended and unin-
tended outcomes.Judged against pre-specified criteria, findings from this
pilot cluster RCT will determine whether progression to a
phase III RCT is justified. If it is, learning from this pilot
will inform refinement of the intervention, its theory of
change and the research methods for a full-scale trial.
Recruitment status
Participant enrolment for baseline surveys began in June
2017. At the time of submission (May 2018), the opti-
misation of the intervention and the student and staff
baseline surveys have been carried out. Schools are in
the process of implementing the intervention and the re-
search team is currently recruiting participants for the
process evaluation.
