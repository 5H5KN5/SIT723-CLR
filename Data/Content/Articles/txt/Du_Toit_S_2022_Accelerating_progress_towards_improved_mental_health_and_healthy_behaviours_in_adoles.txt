ABSTRACT
Adolescents exposed to high levels of adversity are vulnerable to 
developing mental health challenges, with long-lasting adverse 
consequences. Promoting the psychological well-being of adoles -
cents and protecting them from adverse experiences is crucial for 
their quality of life. There is a need for evidence on which combina -
tions of protective factors can improve the wellbeing of adolescents 
to inform future programming efforts. We used data from 
a longitudinal study that took place in Khayelitsha, South Africa, 
a semi-urban impoverished community in Cape Town. Data were 
collected from adolescents when they were 12–14 years of age 
(n = 333) and again at follow-up when they were aged 16– 
19 years (n = 314). A path analysis was used to estimate associations 
between access to service, food security, safe environment, family 
support, and social support and five outcomes related to adoles -
cent mental health and risky behaviours. The fitted model was used 
to calculate adjusted mean differences comparing different combi -
nations of risk factors. Two protective factors (food security and safe 
environment) were positively associated with three outcomes relat -
ing to mental health and the absence of risky behaviours. Further 
investigation revealed that the presence of high food security and 
safer environments was associated with higher adjusted mean 
scores: +16.2% (p < .0001) in no substance use; +16.5% (p < .0001) 
in no internalising behaviour, +19.5% (p < .0001) in self-esteem; 
+12.2% (p < .0001) in positive peer relationships; and +11.4% 
(p < .0001) in no suicidal ideation. Interventions targeting adoles -
cents, that aim to improve food security together with improving 
the safety of their environment, are likely to impact their well- 
being.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
Adolescence is a rapid developmental phase, during which an individual undergoes 
major physical and psychological changes (World Health Organization, 2006b ). Mental 
disorders during adolescence are common, and a strong predictor of mental health 
problems during adulthood (World Health Organization, 2020 ). Adolescents living in 
sub-Saharan Africa have high levels of exposure to poverty, inequality and violence, 
which may exacerbate each other (Cluver et al., 2019 ) and affect their mental health.
The United Nations General Assembly devised the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) in 2015 to guide international development policies to end poverty, protect the 
planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030 (Cluver et al., 2016 ; 
Cluver et al., 2019 ; Nations, 2016 ). SDG 3 focuses on good health and well-being across 
all ages, and comprises indicators relating to lowered mortality and morbidity, better 
mental health and lower substance use (United Nations Development Group, 2015 )
The United Nations Development Group (UNDG) developed the Mainstream, 
Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS) approach as an effective way of reaching the 
SDGs by 2030 (UNDP, 2017 ). Accelerators are a key concept in the MAPS. They are 
described as life circumstances or programmatic areas that directly influence multiple 
SDG outcomes (e.g., food security may not only reduce hunger, but also improve physical 
and mental health and schooling outcomes; UNDP, 2017 ).
The concept of accelerators was first used by Cluver et al. (2019 ) when they identified 
potential accelerators to improve progress towards the SDGs for adolescents living with 
HIV (Cluver et al., 2019 ). They found that three provisions (parenting support, govern -
ment cash transfers, and safe schools) were associated with better outcomes across 11 
SDG-aligned targets (Cluver et al., 2019 ). The accelerator approach has since been success -
fully applied in several studies (Cluver et al., 2020 ; Mebrahtu et al., 2021 ; Meinck et al., 
2021 ). Of note, several of these studies have found positive effects of different accelerators 
on several indicators of mental health (Mebrahtu et al., 2021 ; Meinck et al., 2021 ). Building 
on such findings, the current study applies the accelerator approach to identify measures 
that may improve several, inter-related mental health outcomes simultaneously.
Multiple candidate accelerators are likely to affect mental-health related outcomes in 
the South African context. The gap between rich and poor in South Africa is among the 
widest in the world, with more than half of the country’s youth population living in 
poverty (De Lannoy et al., 2018 ; STATS SA, 2020). Poverty influences mental health 
through a variety of pathways and the relationship is complex and bidirectional (Dashiff 
et al., 2009 ). Adolescents who live in households and communities that are socially and 
economically disadvantaged are at an increased risk of exposure to household and 
community violence, food and income insecurity, which in turn are risk factors for 
poor mental health (Das-Munshi et al., 2016 ; Patel et al., 2007 ). Lastly, family, and social 
support are crucial to mental health and are robustly associated with mental health in 
adolescence (Kuhn & Laird, 2014 ).
While previous studies have established additive effects of multiple accelerators on 
previous outcomes, the concept requires further development to better inform policy 
decisions. The current study takes a unique approach, building on the established PSYCHOLOGY, HEALTH & MEDICINE
 15
importance of high-quality programs (Castillo et al., 2019 ; World Health Organization, 
2004 ), by investigating the differential effects of low, average, and high availability of 
accelerators.
Methods
The current analysis includes data from a longitudinal study that was conducted in South 
Africa between 1999 and 2017. Two time points of the study are included in the analysis: 
First, when the adolescents were between the ages of 12–14 years and second when the 
adolescents were between the ages of 16–19 years.
The aim of this analysis is to determine:
(1)which of the five potential accelerator provisions (access to services, food security, 
safe environment, social support, and family support) are linked to outcomes 
relating to improved mental health and healthy behaviours in adolescents living in 
adversity; and
(2)investigating these associations at different levels of accelerator exposure.
Studies included in analysis
Thula Sana was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a community-based intervention 
programme for mothers, which aimed to improve maternal sensitivity and responsive -
ness (Cooper et al., 2009 ). At 13 years of age, these children were re-enrolled into the 
Saving Brains study to evaluate the long-term impact of the Thula Sana intervention 
programme on child cognitive functioning. No significant long-term impact on child 
outcomes were observed (Tomlinson et al., 2020 ). Zifune was an RCT that aimed to 
evaluate the impact of a second-wave intervention for the Thula Sana cohort, intended to 
prevent interpersonal violence and abuse (Tomlinson et al., 2020 ). The current study 
utilises data from the Saving Brains 13-years assessment (T1) and the baseline measures 
of the Zifune study (T2) (see, Figure 1). Since the sample assessed at both time-points was 
not completely overlapping, our final sample size with full data at both time-points was 
N = 289.
Sample and procedure
Longitudinal data were collected from a sample of adolescents and their mothers living in 
Khayelitsha, a large township located in Cape Town, South Africa. Khayelithsa is 
characterised by high population density, widespread poverty rates, and high rates of 
HIV (Stinson et al., 2016 ). Data were collected in three phases: (1) Thula Sana (preg -
nancy to 18 months; five time-points of assessment); (2) Saving Brains (ages 12–14 years; 
one time-point of assessment); (3) Zifune (ages 16–19 years; three time-points of 
assessment).
All interviews and assessments were conducted by trained and supervised data 
collectors, experienced in working with vulnerable families, and in the participants 
vernacular language (isiXhosa). All three phases of the longitudinal study received ethical 16

approval. Thula Sana , was approved by the research ethics committee of the University of 
Reading (ref:99/20) and the University of Cape Town (ref:180/97). Ethical approval was 
granted by the Health Research Ethics Committee of Stellenbosch for Saving Brains (S12/ 
04/113) and Zifune (N17/10/094).
Measures
Outcomes
We identified five measures that reflected SDG3-related mental health and risky beha -
viour constructs. Details on measures used and coding decisions are provided in 
Appendix 1. A variable for ‘no substance use’ (0–2) was created as a combined measure 
of no harmful drinking (score ≥8 on the AUDIT; Bohn et al., 1995, 1995 /07/01) and no 
use of any illicit drugs. Internalizing behaviour was measured through the Youth Self 
Report (YSR; Achenbach, 1991 ) internalizing subscale (range: 0–62; reverse coded so that 
higher scores indicate lower levels of internalizing behaviour), which comprises the 
Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn/Depressed, and the Somatic complaints subscales. Self- 
esteem was measured at T1 through the Self-Esteem Questionnaire (SEQ: range 42–168; 
split into quartiles; Wild et al., 2005 ) and at T2 through the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale 
(RSES: range: 0–30; split into quartiles; Rosenberg, 1965 ). Healthy peer relationships 
were measured through the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 
1997 ) – Peer-Relationship Problems subscale (range: 0–10). Lastly, no suicidal ideation 
was measured through a single item present in the YSR. Since the aim of the analysis was 
to examine change over time, measures taken at follow-up were chosen as the primary 
outcome variable. However, we controlled for baseline scores to capture change processes 
potentially caused by the accelerator provision. An exception of this was the internalizing 
behaviour outcome, for which a measure was only available at T2.

Hypothesised accelerator provisions
We identified five hypothesised accelerators that may influence mental health and 
healthy behaviour outcomes. Since previous research found that continued access to 
protective factors are required in order for them to be effective (Cluver et al., 2019 ), we 
averaged scores across baseline and follow-up to capture the degree of exposure adoles -
cents had to each factor over time. The hypothesized accelerators included in this study 
were as follows: 1) access to service, which consisted of a continuous score (0–4) 
capturing if the adolescent lived in a formal brick structure and had access to drinking 
water, a flush toilet, and electricity at their premises; 2) food security, which was 
measured through the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS: range:0–27; 
reverse coded so that higher scores indicates higher food security; Coates et al., 2007 ); 3) 
living in a safe environment, with adolescents not witnessing, or directly being exposed to 
community or household violence as measured through the Child Exposure to 
Community Violence (CECV) scale (range:0–69; reverse coded so that higher scores 
indicates higher levels of safety; Amaya-Jackson, 1998 ); 4) social support, which was 
assessed through the Inventory of Social Supportive Behaviour (ISSB; Barrera, 1981 ) that 
captures the extent of social support an individual receives from others (range:19–95; 
split into quartiles); 5) family support, which was measured through the Family 
Assessment Device – general functioning subscale that measures perceived family func -
tioning. (FAD; range:12–48; split into quartiles; Epstein et al., 1983 ).
Covariates
We included two covariates in the analysis: (1) sex of the child; and (2) baseline score of 
the outcome measured.
Analysis
Analyses were conducted in Stata SE v.15. The following six steps were undertaken. Step 1: 
Comparison of those participants whose data was included versus not included in the 
analysis using t-tests and chi2 test as appropriate. Only participants who had data at both 
time-points were included in the analysis (see, Figure 1); Step 2: We conducted Pearson 
correlation analyses to ensure there were no multicollinearity between the five potential 
accelerator provisions. Step 3: We conducted separate regressions for each of the five SDG- 
3 related mental health outcomes, with each outcome being simultaneously regressed onto 
all hypothesized accelerators and control variables (T1 scores, sex). Step 4: We tested for 
evidence that associations between hypothesised accelerator and mental health outcomes 
may be moderated by sex using interaction terms. Step 5: We ran a path analysis with full 
information maximum likelihood to account for missing data. For this, we used path 
analysis including five single-outcome multivariable linear regression models, each regres -
sing one of the five outcomes at follow-up on the five hypothesised protective factors, 
controlling for T1 scores and sex. Outcomes were set to be inter-correlated to account for 
potential clustering of different mental health outcomes. If a predictor was found to affect 
three or more outcomes, it was defined as a potential accelerator. Step 6: To reflect quality 
of provisions, we used our fitted SEM to calculate adjusted mean values for each outcome 
under exposure to low (−1 SD), average (mean score) and high (+1 SD) levels of each 18

accelerator and their combinations. We also calculated adjusted mean differences compar -
ing different scenarios. This provides us with a better understanding of how the quality of 
the accelerators is associated with study outcomes.
Results
Descriptive information
Sociodemographic characteristics, potential accelerator provisions, and outcomes at 
baseline and follow-up are provided in Table 1. Participants not assessed during follow- 
up (n = 43) had lower levels of access to running water and flush toilet on premises; both 
p < .001) at baseline. No differences were found for any other potential accelerator 
provisions or outcomes (p > .07). Of the retained sample, 51.38% were female, with an 
average age of 13.31 years at baseline and 17.20 years at follow-up.
Table 2 shows the results of the Pearson correlation analysis. We found a small negative 
association (r = −.12) between social support and living in a safe environment, and small- 
to medium-sized positive associations between family support and access to services 
(r = .14) and food security (r = .32). With correlations being moderate at maximum, 
our findings suggest no multicollinearity between the hypothesized accelerators.
Multivariable associations between protective factors and outcomes
Table 3 shows the associations between potential accelerator provisions and SDG3- 
related mental health outcomes based on the results of the Structural Equation Model. 
Since we found no evidence that sex moderates the association between potential accel -
erators and study outcomes (see appendix 2), we only investigated main effects, retaining 
sex as a covariate.
The first potential accelerator provision, access to service, was not associated with any 
of the five outcomes (p = 0.06–0.60). Food security was the first accelerator identified 
which was positively associated with no internalizing behaviour (β = 0.34; p = 0.003 ), 
higher self-esteem (β = 0.04; p = 0.005 ), and no suicidal ideation (β = 0.01; p = 0.012 ). 
The second accelerator identified was safe environment, which was positively associated 
with no substance use (β = 0.17; p = 0.02 ), no internalizing behaviour (β = 2.74; 
p = 0.002 ), and healthy peer relationships (β = 0.43; p = 0.032 ).
Social support was significantly associated with higher self-esteem (β = 0.04; p = 0.052 ) 
but no other outcomes, therefore not qualifying as an accelerator. Lastly, family support 
was only positively associated with no internalizing behaviour (β = 1.36; p = 0.024 ) and 
self-esteem (β = 0.29; p = 0.000 ).
Being female positively predicted no substance use (β = 0.42; p < 0.001) , self- 
esteem (β = 0.30; p = 0.012 ), and healthy peer relationships (β = 0.95; p < 0.001 ) but 
was negatively related to no internalizing behaviour (β = −3.95; p < 0.001 ). Being 
male positively predicted no internalizing behaviour, and no suicidal ideation 
(β = −0.04; p = 0.186 ), but was negatively related to no substance use, self-esteem 
and peer relationships. The covariance between the outcomes is reported in 
Appendix 3.PSYCHOLOGY, HEALTH & MEDICINE

Quality of provisions/Adjusted mean values of mental health outcomes comparing 
different combinations of accelerator factors
Figure 2 shows the adjusted mean values for each outcome under exposure to low (−1 SD), 
average (mean score) and high (+1 SD) levels of each of the two identified accelerators 
(food security, safe environment) and their combinations. The first outcome, no substance 
use, had a possible score of 0–2. When fixing food security and environmental safety to 
their lowest scores, the adjusted mean score for no substance use was 1.36. Compared to 
this baseline scenario, fixing both protective factors to their average levels was associated 
with an 8.1% higher mean score. When fixing both protective factors to their highest 
values was associated with a 16.2% higher mean score on the no substance use scale.Table 1. Sociodemographic characteristics, potential accelerator provisions, and outcomes at baseline

No internalizing behaviour had a possible range of 0–62. When fixing food security 
and environmental safety to their lowest scores the adjusted mean internalizing 
behaviour score was 35.78. Compared to this baseline scenario, fixing both protective 
factors to their average levels was associated with an 8.3% higher predicted mean 
score. Fixing both protective factors to their highest values was associated with 
a 16.5% higher mean score on the no internalizing behaviour scale.
Good peer relationships had a possible score of 0–7. When fixing food security and 
environmental safety to their lowest scores the adjusted mean good peer relationship 
score was 4.19. Fixing both protective factors to their average levels was associated with 
a 6% higher predicted mean score. Fixing both protective factors to their highest values 
was associated with a 12.2% higher mean score.
Self-esteem had a possible score of between 1–4. When fixing food security and 
environmental safety to their lowest scores the adjusted mean self-esteem score was 
2.56. Compared to the baseline scenario, fixing both protective factors to their 
average levels was associated with a 9.8% higher predicted mean score. Fixing both 
protective factors to their highest values was associated with a 19.5% higher mean 
score on the self-esteem scale.
Lastly, no suicidal ideation, had a possible score of between 0–1. Fixing both protective 
factors to their lowest score the adjusted mean score was 0.88. Fixing both protective 
factors to their average levels was associated with a 5.7% higher predicted mean score. 
Fixing both protective factors to their highest values was associated with a 11.4% higher 
mean score on no suicidal ideation. See appendix 4 for full results on quality of

Discussion
In this analysis of data from a longitudinal study (Tomlinson et al., 2021 ) we identified 
two accelerators (food security and safe environment) that were associated with at least 
three domains of better mental health and healthier behaviours. This finding contributes 
to the emerging evidence on potential accelerators for supporting adolescent well-being

across Africa (Cluver et al., 2019 ). Food security was positively associated with positive 
self-esteem, an absence of suicidal ideation, and no internalizing behaviour. Living in 
a safe environment was associated with healthy peer relationships, no internalizing 
behaviour and no substance use.
These findings are in line with previous accelerator studies that report being food 
secure and living in a safe environment having positive effects on mental health and 
healthy behaviours (Mebrahtu et al., 2021 ; Sherr et al., 2021 ). This highlights the 
importance of improving food security, as food security not only reduces hunger, but 
also improves physical and mental health. Living within a safe environment is also crucial 
for mental health and healthy behaviours.
We also investigated the effect of the accelerators at different quality levels and found 
that higher quality provision of accelerators, reflected in higher predicted scores on the 
utilized scales, generally predicted better outcomes, with exposure to average levels of both 
accelerators already leading to notable improvements. High quality on one and average 
quality on the other accelerator often led to substantial increases in outcome attainment, 
with high quality on both accelerators commonly leading to the largest effects. These 
findings suggest that resolving food security and safe environments may be more effective 
for improving a range of outcomes relating to mental health and healthy behaviours than 
resolving just one. The stepwise improvements also highlight the importance of the quality 
of these accelerators when aiming to improve mental health and health behaviour out-
comes. Overall, these findings are in line with a recent study, that found that the presence 
of 2–3 accelerators could lead to substantial improvements across a range of SDG out-
comes including indicators relating to mental health (Sherr et al., 2021 ).
This study supports other recent findings (Mebrahtu et al., 2021 ; Sherr et al., 2021 ) on 
the importance of food security and safe environments in the mental health and healthy 
behaviour of adolescents. It provides initial evidence on the potential benefits of combin -
ing these two accelerators, at a high-quality level, in mitigating adverse outcomes in 
adolescents in South Africa. Food security can be attained through various interventions 
such as providing nutritional support and enhancing access to food sources (De Groot 
et al., 2017 ; Sherr et al., 2021 ). An integrated approach should be taken to address the 
safety in communities, which includes addressing the underlying drivers of crime and 
violence (e.g., substance abuse and unemployment), and strengthening the criminal 
justice system and the police (Kruger et al., 2016 ). Safety has a direct impact on sustain -
able development and high levels of violence in South Africa has delayed economic 
growth and transformation. These findings are important for developing social policy 
initiatives for increasing food security and safe environment for enhancing the future 
achievements for adolescents in South Africa.
This study had a few limitations. First, the study utilised a small sample size, which 
could lower power and prevented us from doing sex-specific analyses. Second, only 
a small number of the sample reported suicidality, which may make predictions less 
reliable. Third, for some outcomes, different measures were used at baseline and follow- 
up. Lastly, although rigorous research methods ensure the highest possible internal 
validity, as an observational study we are unable to establish whether estimated associa -
tions are causal. Strengths were that the research was conducted using longitudinal data, 
that there were high retention rates, and we accounted for missing values using full PSYCHOLOGY, HEALTH & MEDICINE

information maximum likelihood. Nevertheless, there is still a risk of residual confound -
ing from unmeasured variables such as caregiver attitudes and knowledge, and future 
research should consider this.
Conclusion
It is concluded that promoting food security and safe environments are crucial to improve 
the mental health of adolescents while also promoting healthy behaviours. Resolving food 
security and safe environments may be more effective for improving a range of outcomes 
relating to mental health and healthy behaviours than just resolving one. It provides initial 
evidence on the potential benefits of combining these two accelerators, at a high-quality 
level, in mitigating adverse outcomes in adolescents in South Africa.
