interventions to change professionals ’practice:
an illustration from the Good Goals study in
occupational therapy
Niina Kolehmainen1,2*and Jill J Francis1,2
Abstract
Background: It is widely agreed that interventions to change professionals ’practice need to be clearly specified.
This involves (1) selecting and defining the intervention techniques, (2) operationalising the techniques and
deciding their delivery, and (3) formulating hypotheses about the mechanisms through which the techniques are
thought to result in change. Descriptions of methods to achieve these objectives are limited. This paper reports
methods and illustrates outputs from a study to meet these objectives, specifically from the Good Goals study to
improve occupational therapists ’caseload management practice.
Methods: (1) Behaviour change techniques were identified and selected from an existing matrix that maps
techniques to determinants. An existing coding manual was used to define the techniques. (2) A team of
occupational therapists generated context-relevant, acceptable modes of delivery for the techniques; these data
were compared and contrasted with previously collected data, literature on caseload management, and the aims of
the intervention. (3) Hypotheses about the mechanisms of change were formulated by drawing on the matrix and
on theories of behaviour change.
Results: (1) Eight behaviour change techniques were selected: goal specified; self-monitoring; contract; graded
tasks; increasing skills (problem solving, decision making, goal setting); coping skills; rehearsal of relevant skills; social
processes of encouragement, support, and pressure; demonstration by others; and feedback. (2) A range of modes
of delivery were generated ( e.g., graded tasks ’consisting of series of clinical cases and situations that become
increasingly difficult). Conditions for acceptable delivery were identified ( e.g.,‘self-monitoring ’was acceptable only if
delivered at team level). The modes of delivery were specified as face-to-face training, task sheets, group tasks,
DVDs, and team-based weekly meetings. (3) The eight techniques were hypothesized to target caseload
management practice through eleven mediating variables. Three domains were hypothesized to be most likely to
change: beliefs about capabilities, motivation and goals, and behavioural regulation.
Conclusions: The project provides an exemplar of a systematic and reportable development of a
quality-improvement intervention, with its methods likely to be applicable to other projects. A subsequent study of
the intervention has provided early indication that use of systematic methods to specify interventions may help to
maximize acceptability and effectiveness.

Background
Implementation science is concerned with changing
healthcare professionals ’practice. An approach that is
frequently adopted to achieve this is the development
and use of behaviour change interventions. There is a
wide consensus that behaviour change interventionsneed to be clearly specified in order to have maximum
likelihood of effectiveness and to be replicable [1-5].
Specifying interventions involves three objectives: (1) se-
lect and define the intervention techniques ; (2) operation-
alise the techniques and decide their delivery (including
mode, context, dosage, and frequency); and (3) formulate
hypotheses about the mechanisms through which the
techniques are thought to result in change [1,3,5-8]. Few
among existing interventions to change professionals ’
practice have been clearly specified [9]. One likely reason
for this is that there are currently only limited exemplars
and no agreement on methods for specifying interven-tions. In other words, there is a consensus about the
standards for reporting interventions before evaluation
but little information about the ways to achieve thesestandards. Frameworks such as the UK Medical Research
Council (MRC) framework for complex interventions
[1,2] and intervention mapping [10] have been very use-ful in guiding the methods for overall intervention de-
velopment; however, they do not provide details on
systematic methods for specifying the interventions.
Two papers, describing development of interventions
to improve mental health professionals ’disclosure of de-
mentia [11] and general practitioners ’management of
upper respiratory tract infections [12], represent a sig-
nificant step in methods for specifying interventions to
change professionals ’practice. With regard to the three
dimensions of specifying interventions, these papers de-
scribe a replicable method for selecting intervention tech-
niques through the use of a behaviour change techniquematrix [13] and labels for methods related to operationa-
lising the techniques ( “iterative process using the study
team members ”[11,12]) and deciding the delivery of the
intervention techniques ( “cognitive interviewing ”[11,12]).
Other subsequent publications have provided further la-
bels for methods related to operationalising interventiontechniques ( e.g.,“designed a prototype ”or“conducted
usability testing ”). These papers have made a valuable
contribution to the field; however, there are aspects thatlimit their replicability. Specifically, these papers do not
describe methods for defining the techniques ( e.g., how is
it decided what ‘persuasive communication ’or‘modeling ’
consist of?), and they do not describe the content and ap-
plication ( i.e., the procedure) of the methods (only the
label) for operationalising the intervention techniquesand for deciding their delivery and formulating hypoth-
eses. Further exemplars with fuller descriptions of con-
tent and application of the methods are required to allowimplementation scientists to specify interventions to the
agreed standard.
The present paper builds on existing publications by
replicating the previously described methods where pos-
sible and further developing and elaborating them. The
aim is to provide an exemplar of systematic methods forspecifying interventions to change professionals ’practice.
There is no established consensus for reporting studies
concerning developing and specifying interventions or
on the quality criteria against which the methods should
be evaluated. In terms of quality criteria, as quality of
randomised controlled trials is evaluated on the basis ofreliability and validity of the methods used [7] (not on
the trial outcomes), quality of studies focusing on devel-
oping and specifying interventions should also be evalu-ated on the basis of their methods (rather than, e.g., the
ultimate effectiveness of the intervention). For
the present study, we aspired to three quality criteria: (1)the methods are replicable by others, (2) the methods
systematically synthesise evidence and theory about the
techniques that should be included in the interventionand about the delivery of these techniques, and (3) the
application of the methods results in an intervention
that is clearly specified (in terms of its techniques, theirdelivery, and mechanisms of change). In terms of report-
ing, the present paper is structured according to the
three objectives related to specifying interventions (seeabove, and Figure 1). The following sections report the
context of the study and the methods and outputs as they
relate to each objective.
Objective/Step 1:  Select and define the intervention techniques

Methods
The study context and the theoretical model of the
problem
The present study was part of a program of research
aimed at improving efficiency and equity of occupational
therapists ’caseload management. Efficiency and equity
are major challenges to most health services, and pro-
fessionals ’caseload management practices ( i.e., their be-
haviours related to assessment, treatment, and dischargingof patients) may provide a way of addressing these [14-17].
A theoretical model of professionals ’caseload manage-
ment [17] (based on synthesis of qualitative and quantita-tive evidence and theories of human behaviour) indicates
that effective caseload management is predicted by pro-
fessionals ’three behaviours: (1) identify clear and spe-
cific treatment goals, (2) agree the treatment goals with
the patient, and (3) evaluate the patient ’s progress to-
wards the goals at a specified date. According to themodel [17], professionals ’performance of these three
‘target behaviours ’is related to variables within seven
‘theoretical domains ’(i.e., clusters of behavioural deter-
minants [18]). These seven theoretical domains are as
follows: professional role and identity, skills, beliefs about
capabilities, motivation and goals, social influences, emo-tion, and behavioural regulation [17]. In other words, the
model proposes that the frequency with which a profes-
sional, for example, agrees goals with patients is relatedto the professional ’s belief about whether or not agreeing
goals with patients is part of his or her role and responsi-
bilities, the professional ’s skills in agreeing goals with
patients, and the importance that agreeing goals with
patients has to the professional when also considering
other priorities that he or she has. The model was usedas the initial theoretical basis [2] for the present study.
The present study did not require research ethics com-
mittee approval as it involved collaboration with an ad-visory team rather than collection of new data.
Three steps to specifying the intervention
As noted above (in Background), specifying interven-tions involves three objectives: (1) select and define theintervention techniques to be delivered, (2) operational-
ise the techniques and decide on their delivery, and (3)
formulate hypotheses about the mechanisms of change.
In the present study, each of the objectives was met
through a corresponding step (Figure 1). The steps mir-rored the broad approach to developing complex inter-
ventions recommended by the MRC [1,2] and, more
specifically, the way in which the causal modeling ap-proach [19] has been applied in the development of
interventions to change practice [11,12]. The following
sections report the specific methods used to conducteach of the three steps.Step 1: select and define the intervention techniques to
be delivered
Specifying an intervention requires selecting the tech-
niques to be delivered ( i.e., the ‘active ingredients ’de-
signed to be used to produce change in the outcomes
[1]). Ideally, the techniques are chosen on the basis ofexplicitly theorised empirical evidence of effectiveness
from previous studies in the field [19]. Empirical evi-
dence about the effectiveness of different techniques inchanging professionals ’practice is scarce [20,21], and
therefore, other approaches are needed. One recom-
mended approach is to use evidence-based theories fromother fields [22,23]. Various tools have been developed
to facilitate this; one of these is the matrix that consists
of 35 behaviour change techniques and eleven theoret-ical domains of behavioural determinants [13]. The
matrix has been derived, using expert consensus, from a
range of theories related to professionals ’practice [13],
and it indicates whether or not there is expert endorse-
ment of a specific technique ( e.g.,‘graded tasks ’)t ob e
used to target specific domains ( e.g.,‘skills ’). In the
matrix, individual techniques may be proposed to target
several domains ( e.g., the ‘graded tasks ’technique has
been proposed to target the domains ‘skills ’,‘beliefs about
capabilities ’, and ‘motivation and goals ’), and similarly, it
has been proposed that some domains can be changed
by using a number of techniques. The matrix can beused to systematically identify techniques for inclusion
in interventions to change practice [11,12], and the
matrix was therefore used in the present study.
To systematically identify relevant techniques from the
matrix, the seven theoretical domains ( i.e., professional
role and identity, skills, beliefs about capabilities, motiv-ation and goals, social influences, emotion, and behav-
ioural regulation) related to the target behaviours [17]
were used to work through the rows of the matrix. Spe-cifically, the behaviour change techniques that, according
to the matrix, target at least two of the seven domains
were identified and selected for inclusion in the interven-tion. All other techniques ( i.e., those that were not
selected for inclusion) in the matrix were excluded.
The publication that reported the matrix [13] also re-
ported a list of labels for behaviour change techniques
(and brief definitions for some of them) that were ex-tracted from publications and textbooks and elicited from
researchers to generate a starting point for matrix de-
velopment. In parallel with the development of the matrix,a coding manual for behaviour change interventions [24]
was published. It provides explicit definitions for 26 be-
haviour change techniques and reports evidence of reli-ability of the definitions. That coding manual was used in
the present study to define the selected techniques. The
process for matching the techniques from the matrix withthose in the coding manual are reported in Results (StepKolehmainen and Francis Implementation Science 2012, 7:100 Page 3 of 10

1). The next step was to operationalise the selected
techniques and decide on their delivery (see below).
Step 2: operationalise the techniques and decide on
their delivery
Operationalising the selected techniques involves de-
ciding how the techniques will be put into practice. In
the present study this was done by collaborating with an
advisory team of occupational therapists. The criteriaused to select the team were as follows:
▪the team membership combines experience in clinical
and professional issues and in a range of contextual
factors ( e.g., geographical mix, client mix,
organizational structure);
▪the team members are motivated and committed to
involvement in the intervention development;
▪the team is accustomed to critical and constructive
discussion; and
▪the team is based within a manageable travel distance
from the research team.
Six teams were considered; one team that met the criteria
was approached and agreed to be involved. Two 60-minute
meetings with the team were arranged. At the meetings,
the target behaviours, the seven theoretical domains, and
the intervention techniques selected (see Step 1 above)were presented to the team in the following form:)
“The aim is to increase therapists ’[the name of the
theoretical domain, e.g.,‘skills ’or ‘beliefs about
capabilities ’] in [the behaviour, i.e.,‘identifying goals ’or
‘agreeing goals ’or‘evaluating progress towards goals ’].
We want to do this through [the name of the behaviour
change technique, e.g.,‘graded tasks ’or‘self-monitoring ’].
Can you think of ideas for how we could do this? ”
Definitions for the behaviour change techniques (see
Step 1, above) and examples of the factors within the the-oretical domains were also presented to the team. (The
examples were based on the data underpinning the model
of caseload management.) The team was encouraged to
first brainstorm a range of ideas for operationalising the
techniques in an uncritical manner before discussing theacceptability of these ideas. The role of the researcher was
to record and prompt discussion. The team was not invited
to identify additional techniques; the focus was solely onoperationalising the techniques identified at Step 1. After
each meeting, the team ’s responses were compared against
▪the technique definitions from Step 1;
▪previously collected qualitative and quantitative data
about occupational therapists ’caseload management
[17];▪literature related to the topic ( i.e., literature about
community health and social care professionals ’
caseload management practice) [ 25]; and
▪
literature about professionals ’practice and human
behaviour and the aims of the intervention.
The team ’s responses that were compatible with
these were accepted and included in the intervention
protocol without modification. The responses that were(either in whole or in part) incompatible with these
were put aside for further consideration and eventually
disregarded —the implications of this are further dis-
cussed in results for Step 2. The third objective, and
the final step of the study, was to formulate hypoth-
eses about the mechanisms of change; this is describednext.
Step 3: formulate hypotheses about the mechanisms
of change
Hypotheses about the mechanisms of change ( i.e., the
relationships between the techniques identified in Step1, the hypothesized determinants of the target beha-
viours, and the target behaviours themselves) were devel-
oped. This was done in two parts. First, the first authorused the matrix of behaviour change techniques [12] to
develop hypotheses about the theoretical domains that
each technique is likely to target. Specifically, the consensuspanel ’s agreement that a technique could be used to target
a domain was taken as sufficient evidence to hypothesize
that there may be a causal relationship between the tech-nique and any of the behavioural determinants within that
domain.
Second, theories of human behaviour were used to
identify any relationships that may exist between the
techniques and the determinants that are not reflected
in the matrix. Specifically, the first author identifiedthree theories that cover the determinants relevant to
this study and also include behaviour change techni-
ques: Social Cognitive Theory [26], Control Theory[27], and Goal and Implementation Intentions [28]. The
two authors then discussed the hypotheses presented in
these theories and identified the hypotheses concerningany of the selected techniques having an impact on any
determinants residing within the seven domains relevant
to the target behaviours. The identified hypotheses wereadded to those already included on the basis of the
matrix.

The following sections report the outputs that resultedfrom the present study. The outputs are presented in re-
lation to each objective/step.Kolehmainen and Francis Implementation Science 2012, 7:100 Page 4 of 10

Step 1: selected intervention techniques and their
definitions
Ten behaviour change techniques that met the criteria
were identified from the matrix (Table 1). A limitation in
the matrix was noted in relation to one technique ( i.e.,
‘feedback ’); both theory and evidence strongly indicate
that this technique is likely to be useful for targeting be-
havioural regulation, but the matrix does not indicate
this. A decision was taken to include feedback; as a re-sult, eleven techniques were identified.
Definitions from the coding manual [24] were available
for eight of the eleven techniques (Table 1); further con-sideration was required for the remaining three techni-
ques. One technique (social processes of encouragement,
pressure, and support) was included in the intervention,and a definition for it was generated by combining tech-
nique definitions from the coding matrix. One technique(increasing skills: problem solving, decision making, goal
setting) was dropped from the intervention at Step 1
(Table 1) and another at Step 2 (see following section) asthey were not considered relevant. As such, definitions
were established for all included techniques.
Step 2: operationalised techniques and their delivery
The advisory team consisted of eight senior occupational
therapists and one technical instructor. The outcomesfrom the meetings have been summarized in relation to
each behaviour change technique in Table 2; full materi-
als and minutes from the meetings are available fromthe first author. In addition to the advice related to the
specific techniques, the team also recommended that the
intervention should not require the service to changetheir paperwork ( i.e., the way client notes, reports, etc.
are recorded) and that the intervention should include
Table 1 Techniques identified for inclusion in the intervention, whether a definition was available from the coding
manual, action taken, and the definitions adopted
Technique Definition available
[24]Action taken
Goal specified Yes Used the definition from the coding manual:
“A very specific definition of the behaviour, with at least one of the following
specified: where, when, how, or with whom ”
Contract Yes Used the definition from the coding manual:
“Agreement so that there is a written record witnessed by another ”
Self-monitoring Yes Used the definition from the coding manual:
“Keeping a record of specified behaviour ”
Rewards Yes Used the definition from the coding manual:
“Praise, encouragement, and/or material rewards —the reward must be
explicitly linked to the achievement of specified goals ”
Graded tasks Yes Used the definition from the coding manual:
“A sequence of tasks that start from easy and become increasingly difficult ”
Increasing skills (problem solving,
decision making, goal setting)No The technique was excluded because
▪there was no evidence to suggest that therapists required intervention
with respect to decision-making or problem-solving skills [ 17], and
▪goal-setting skills were already targeted extensively through the techniques
of graded tasks and rehearsal
Coping skills No Technique was excluded (see results for step 2)
Rehearsal of relevant skill Yes Used the definition from the coding manual:
“Repeat the behaviour or preparatory behaviours numerous times ”
Social processes of encouragement,
pressure, and supportDefinitions for four
similar techniquesUsed the definitions for the four similar techniques ( ‘general encouragement ’,
‘opportunities for social comparison ’,‘social support/change ’, and ‘information
about others ’approval ’) to produce a single definition:
“Opportunities for mutual support, sharing, and comparison, including clarification
of whether others like, approve of, or disapprove of what one is doing ”
Modeling/ demonstration by others Yes Used the definition from the coding manual:
“Showing how to perform a behaviour correctly ”
Feedback Yes Used the definition from the coding manual:
“Providing data about or commenting on a person ’s action in relation to a
set goal or in relation to the performance of others ”Kolehmainen and Francis Implementation Science 2012, 7:100 Page 5 of 10

tools to support implementation in practice as opposed
to training sessions only.
Following a comparison and contrasting of the advis-
ory team ’s recommendations with the other sources of
evidence/theory (see Methods, Step 2), the key decisions
were as follows:
(i) the intervention would be delivered to a whole
service (as opposed to an individual clinician) toincrease the likelihood of acceptability and
effectiveness [ 29];
(ii) the ‘social processes of encouragement and support ’
technique was delivered throughout the
intervention in as large and frequent amounts as
possible;(iii) emotional support and rewards were built into the
‘social processes of support and encouragement ’
technique, as the team identified this as the currentand preferred method of coping with emotions
related to practice, and the techniques ‘coping skills ’
and ‘rewards ’were dropped; and
(iv) ‘social processes of pressure ’and ‘self-monitoring ’
were built into the intervention covertly as team-
level self-monitoring ( i.e., teams within the service
and therapists within the teams self-monitor
actions and progress).
The main outputs from this step were three inter-
vention components, with a list of the intervention tech-
niques included in each component, and a manual toTable 2 Summary of the clinical advisory team ’s comments and recommendations regarding the acceptability and
delivery of the specific intervention techniques
The technique Comments about acceptability and delivery
Goal specified AND Having specific goals for therapists (as opposed to therapy goals for patients) is
likely to range from contentious to highly unacceptable.contract
Having goals for a team is likely to require persuasion, and success is likely todepend on the goals. Supportive and encouraging, rather than normative,
team goals are likely to be more acceptable.
Goals that allow measurement of progress or comparison between individual therapists are
likely to be highly unacceptable.
“Targets ”are likely to be associated with “sales ”and thus likely to be strongly opposed to
therapists ’professional identity.
Self-monitoring AND feedback In general, any monitoring or feedback, and especially external monitoring/feedback,
about individual therapists ’practice is likely to be highly unacceptable.
Low levels of self-monitoring might be acceptable if combined with use of social processes
of encouragement and support.
Rewards Social support and encouragement is valued very highly.Graded tasks AND Highly desirable, especially for the target behaviours of formulating goals and agreeing
goals —for as long as the tasks were presented in a way that was relevant to practice.Rehearsal of relevant skills
Could involve grading the target behaviours in terms of the other people involved
(e.g., whether goals are formulated with parent or with the child) and context.
Coping skills Current method of coping with emotional aspects of practice is to draw on professional
community for support; this is effective and preferable to therapists.
Social processes of encouragement
and supportEmphasis should be on mutual support, positive interactions, and sharing.
Changing practice as part of a team is likely to be more acceptable than changing practice individually.This technique should be included in all aspects of the intervention as far as possible
and in high dose and frequency.
Social processes of pressure It might be acceptable to establish some team norms, but these would need to be carefully
negotiated if therapists ’motivation to comply with the norms is hoped to be gained.
Explicit social pressure from colleagues or manager is likely to be highly unacceptable,
and the intervention should be designed so that it cannot be used to exert pressure.
It might be acceptable to include expectations from parents, but acceptability of this is likely
to be contingent on therapists ’holding a professional norm about the importance of
client-centred practice.
Any technique that is not, or appears not to be, in line with being an autonomous
practitioner is likely to be rejected.
Modeling/ demonstration of the behaviour Examples by others, as part of the social processes of support, would be desirable.Kolehmainen and Francis Implementation Science 2012, 7:100 Page 6 of 10

facilitate standardizing the delivery of the components
and the techniques within them. The components, thetechniques included in them, and their delivery are
summarized in Table 3 (please contact the first author
for the full manual). The components are two full-daytraining sessions, two tools for change, and team
workbooks. The context of delivery for all three com-
ponents is participants ’place of work (or, for compo-
nent 1, a related training facility). Component 1 is
delivered to the whole service by a trained facilitator;components 2 and 3 are self-administered by the
teams.
At the end of step 2, the intervention was titled Good
Goals. In its current form, Good Goals is designed to be
delivered by a trained facilitator with sufficient experi-
ence of the National Health Services (child health) con-text and the relevant competencies for delivering the
behaviour change techniques included in the interven-
tion (but not an expert in clinical practice and/or in sci-ence of behaviour change).Step 3: hypotheses about the mechanisms of change
A total of 20 hypotheses were formed; a summary ofthese is presented in Table 4. Eleven of the hypotheses
were formed solely on the basis of the matrix, two were
formed solely on the basis of a theory, and seven wereformed on the basis of both the matrix and the theory.
All included techniques were hypothesized to work
through at least two domains. The domains that were
hypothesized to be mostly targeted were beliefs about
capabilities, motivation and goals, and behavioural regu-lation. Six of the seven domains (all except emotion)
were hypothesized to be targeted (please see Results,
Step 2 for operationalisation of the techniques to sup-port coping with emotions related to practice).

specific target behaviours were (1) identify clear and spe-
cific treatment goals, (2) agree the treatment goals with
the patient, and (3) evaluate the patient ’s progress to-
wards the goals at a specified date. The methods included
(i) use of existing theory and tools to select and define in-
tervention techniques, (ii) systematic procedures for re-ceiving and considering advice about acceptability and
delivery from an advisory group (a clinical team of oc-
cupational therapists), and (iii) development of clear hy-potheses about the mechanisms through which the
intervention techniques (and thus the intervention as a
whole) are thought to result in change in the targetbehaviours.
There are a number of methodological limitations.
Despite the effort to use systematic and replicable pro-cesses, it is uncertain that operationalising the interven-
tion techniques (step 2) with a different advisory panel
would result in an exact replication of the interventionas designed. For example, a different advisory team
might have had different views about the acceptability of
the techniques or might have suggested different tasksfor operationalising the graded tasks. However, little has
been published about methods for operationalising inter-
vention techniques to date, and, despite its limitations,
the present study contributes to the ongoing research
[11,12,34,35] in intervention design. Also, the effects ofthe selected intervention techniques on the behavioural
determinants were not empirically explored [12,36]. How-
ever, the clear specification of the techniques and theirdelivery, as well as their proposed relationships to the
outcomes, will facilitate this investigation in a future ef-
fectiveness study [1,2].
The methods described in this exemplar project could
be used to design and specify interventions for other im-
plementation problems. For example, persistent im-plementation challenges related to professionals ’practice(e.g., use of research evidence [37] and use of standar-
dized outcome measures [38]) have been identified to re-
late, at least in part, to factors such as confidence, skills,and knowledge that are modifiable by behaviour change
techniques. However, for application in other topics,
the methods presented here have a prerequisite: thereneeds to be an explicit theory of the outcome being
targeted. In the present project, the authors ’ability to
carry out the work relied on a previously developedtheoretical model of professionals ’caseload management
[17]. The model provided information about the
hypothesized determinants of the professionals ’practice
and, through this, directly guided the selection of the
intervention techniques ( i.e., the ‘active ingredients ’
designed to achieve change in the outcome). It was onlyafter these had been selected that it was possible to oper-
ationalise the delivery of the techniques with the clinical
team ( i.e., to specify the mode of delivery for the techni-
ques). Thus, it would be difficult to apply the methods
presented here without first developing a theoretical
model of the professionals ’action(s) that one aimed to
change.
One of the challenges for the project described in
this paper was identification of the quality standards
against which it should be evaluated. As the methods
in developing and specifying complex interventions tochange practice progress, it may be that reporting stan-
dards for development of interventions (as opposed to
just the interventions themselves) can be agreed upon.Over time, this has the potential to facilitate a cumula-
tive science and optimise the use of resources. As inter-
vention development becomes more systematic andtransparent, it will be easier to ensure that the quality
of the process used to develop individual interventions
is such as to warrant their (often expensive) large-scaleevaluation.Table 4 Behaviour-change techniques included in the intervention and the theoretical domains they were

Next steps
Good Goals is the first community caseload manage-
ment intervention that has been systematically designedusing theory and previous evidence [25]. Results from a
recently completed study that investigated the use of
Good Goals in practice [39] indicate that the issues con-sidered during the intervention specification correspond
well with the issues related to its actual use in practice.
The decisions made during the intervention specificationalso appeared to have facilitated the acceptability of the
intervention, and the change in clinicians ’performance
of the target behaviours was found to be considerablylarger than typically seen in studies of professionals ’
practice. These findings provide some early indication
that specifying interventions by using systematic meth-ods may be advantageous.

Authors ’contributions
NK, with advice from JJF, designed the study and developed the studyprotocol. NK and JJF selected the intervention techniques; NK coordinated
and conducted the clinical advisory team meetings and analyzed the data
from these. NK combined the techniques into an intervention and preparedthe intervention manual. JJF commented on the manual. JJF providedadvice and expertise throughout the study. NK prepared the first draft of the
manuscript; JJF provided substantial intellectual contribution on all drafts.
Both authors approved the final version of the manuscript and takeresponsibility for its content.
Declaration of funding
The study was funded by the Chief Scientist Office of the ScottishGovernment Health Directorates (ref: CZF/1/38). The views expressed in thispaper are those of the authors. The funder was not involved in the conduct
of the study or preparation of the manuscript.
Acknowledgments
