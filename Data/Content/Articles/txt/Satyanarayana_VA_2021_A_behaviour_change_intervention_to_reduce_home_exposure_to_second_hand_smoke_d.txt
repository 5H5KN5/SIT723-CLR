Abstract
Background: Home exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) is highly prevalent amongst pregnant women in low-
and middle-income countries like India and Bangladesh. The literature on the efficacy of behaviour change
interventions to reduce home exposure to SHS in pregnancy is scarce.
Methods: We employed a theory and evidence-based approach to develop an intervention using pregnant
women as agents of change for their husband ’s smoking behaviours at home. A systematic review of SHS
behaviour change interventions led us to focus on developing a multicomponent intervention and informed
selection of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) for review in a modified Delphi survey. The modified Delphi
survey provided expert consensus on the most effective BCTs in reducing home exposure to SHS. Finally, a
qualitative interview study provided context and detailed understanding of knowledge, attitudes and practices
around SHS. This insight informed the content and delivery of the proposed intervention components.
Results: The final intervention consisted of four components: a report on saliva cotinine levels of the pregnant
woman, a picture booklet containing information about SHS and its impact on health as well strategies to
negotiate a smoke-free home, a letter from the future baby to their father encouraging him to provide a smoke-
free home, and automated voice reminder and motivational messages delivered to husbands on their mobile
phone. Intervention delivery was in a single face-to-face session with a research assistant who explained the
cotinine report, discussed key strategies for ensuring a smoke-free environment at home and practised with
pregnant women how they would share the booklet and letter with their husband and supportive family members.
Conclusion: A theory and evidence-based approach informed the development of a multicomponent behaviour
change intervention, described here. The acceptability and feasibility of the intervention which was subsequently
tested in a pilot RCT in India and Bangladesh will be published later.

Background
Over one-third of all women, globally, are exposed to
secondhand smoke (SHS) [ 1–3]. In low- and middle-
income (LAMI) countries, most SHS exposure amongst
women in the reproductive age group occurs at home,
where women spend most of their time [ 4,5]. Estimates
of home exposure to SHS have ranged from 17.8% in
Mexico to 72.3% in Vietnam [ 6]. A more recent study
[7] using the Demographic and Health Survey data
(2008 and 2013) from 30 LAMI countries ( N= 37,427
pregnant women) found that the weighted country-
specific prevalence of SHS exposure ranged from 7% (6 –
9%) in Nigeria to 81% (72 –88%) in Armenia. More than
50% of pregnant women reported some (daily, weekly,
monthly or less than monthly) SHS exposure in five
countries (Jordan, Armenia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and
Nepal), and more than 50% of pregnant women reported
daily SHS exposure in three countries (Jordan, Armenia
and Indonesia). Pregnant women in the Southeast Asian
countries had the highest probability of exposure. Those
in urban areas had a higher probability for household
SHS exposure than pregnant women in rural areas. Ex-
posure to SHS during pregnancy is associated with a
range of adverse maternal and infant health outcomes
such as pregnancy complications, low birth weight, still
birth, small for gestational age infants and sudden infant
death syndrome [ 8–13].
Studies have speculated that women in China,
Cambodia and India may often be unable to negotiate a
smoke-free home with their husbands possibly due to
patriarchy, gender inequity and gendered power interac-
tions [ 9,14,15]. Additional factors include low literacy
levels, lack of awareness about the possible dangers of
home exposure to SHS and culturally held beliefs about
men ’s smoking behaviours. A typical example of such
beliefs is that smoking helps them unwind after a long
day ’s work, which prevents negotiation for a smoke-free
home [ 8–10,16–18]. For example, a study from China
demonstrated that despite women holding negative atti-
tudes towards smoking, they either rationalized men ’ssmoking or chose not to assert their views for fear of
causing conflict at home [ 19]. The World Health
Organization (WHO) provides guidelines recommending
antenatal care providers to routinely screen pregnant
women for tobacco use and home exposure to SHS and
suggests strategies for smoking cessation and prevention
of home exposure to SHS [ 20]. Intervention studies on
reducing home exposure to SHS have included a range
of education and counselling/brief advice strategies de-
livered by health workers to create awareness, enhance
knowledge about its harms, attempt attitudinal change
and suggest practical methods of ensuring a smoke-free
home [ 21]. Very few studies have, however, included
strategies that allow the woman to negotiate a smoke-
free home with significant male family members [ 22].
Our work aimed to develop a multicomponent interven-
tion that incorporated this strategy (focusing particularly
on the pregnant women ’s husbands) alongside other
established behaviour change techniques (BCTs) [ 23]t o
allow a comprehensive approach to reducing exposure
to SHS in the home environment during pregnancy.
Methods
We adopted a theory and evidence-based approach to
intervention development [ 24,25]. We conducted a sys-
tematic review to obtain a critical understanding of the
evidence base, a modified Delphi survey to obtain expert
consensus on effective BCTs and qualitative interviews for
contextual understanding of knowledge, attitudes and
SHS practices. The key findings from each of these three
complementary studies informed the development of the
IMPRESS ( Intervention for Mothers during Pregnancy to
Reduce Exposure to Second hand Smoke) intervention at
a workshop held in Dhaka, Bangladesh (see Fig. 1).
Systematic review (detailed methods described elsewhere
[22])
The systematic review (a) reported the behaviour change
interventions for reduction in home exposure to SHS in
pregnant women and (b) critically appraised intervention
reporting, as well as generalisability, feasibility and scal-
ability of these interventions. It identified six studies for
inclusion. These studies evaluated interventions target-
ing pregnant women, delivered in antenatal clinics, at
home, by telephone or a mix of these. They focused on
education about SHS and/or developing skills in women
to avoid SHS exposure or negotiate with a family mem-
ber, usually the husband. Five interventions were under-
pinned by a behaviour change framework, for example,
the Transtheoretical Model of Change [ 26] and the
Health Belief Model [ 27].
We present below the contribution of (a) to our inter-
vention development. An important observation was
that the evidence was insufficient to provide guidanceSatyanarayana et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:74 Page 2 of 9
on the essential components of the IMPRESS interven-
tion indicating the need for a modified Delphi Survey to
obtain expert consensus on effective BCTs in reducing
home exposure to SHS.
Regarding (b), reporting of the intervention studies did
not meet the Workgroup for Intervention Development
and Evaluation Research (WIDER) guidelines for report-
ing of behaviour change interventions [ 28] and no stud-
ies met all generalizability, feasibility and scalability
criteria. Whilst these findings were not relevant to the
development of the IMPRESS intervention, they
highlighted the importance of detailed reporting of the
development process, its theoretical underpinning and
subsequent evaluation.
Modified Delphi survey
This was conducted to build consensus amongst inter-
national experts and identify the most effective BCTs to
reduce home exposure to SHS in pregnant women. Our
approach differed from the original Delphi method in
that independent opinion was sought via email rather
than face-to-face consultation with a group of experts,
and an evidence-based list of BCTs was generated by the
investigators and emailed to the experts [ 25]. This is a
time and cost-efficient method of achieving consensus
amongst international experts [ 29,30].
Sample
The sample comprised of experts who were lead authors
of peer-reviewed international publications in the areas
of smoking cessation, SHS and behaviour change inter-
ventions. We attempted to have global representation.
Through a process of discussion and elimination, weidentified a final group of 30 experts who were contacted
via email requesting their participation in the survey.
We had experts participate from both LAMI
(Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, China) and high-income
countries (USA, UK, Canada, Australia).
Procedure
A seminal publication on BCTs [ 23], our systematic re-
view [ 22] and a recent paper on BCTs in waterpipe
smoking [ 31] were used to generate a list of BCTs that
were most relevant to reduction of home exposure to
SHS. Initially, 32 BCTs were short listed by VS of which
21 BCTs were rated by two members of the research
team (VS, KS Kappa = 0.92) as most relevant to reduc-
tion of SHS at home during pregnancy. The BCTs that
were eliminated at this stage focused primarily on smok-
ing cessation rather than reduction of home smoking
alone. The 21 BCTs included enhancing knowledge and
awareness, making an appraisal of risks and benefits, and
using specific strategies such as prompts, problem solv-
ing, negotiation etc. (see Additional File 1). Three
rounds of Delphi were chosen a priori to reach an
acceptable consensus.
In the first round of the Delphi, 30 experts were re-
quested to rank in the order of preference the most ef-
fective BCTs that in their opinion were likely to reduce
home exposure to SHS. To aid their judgement of im-
portance, they were requested to consider acceptability,
deliverability and efficacy of each BCT. Their responses
were anonymous. As background information, experts
were informed that our proposed multicomponent inter-
vention was likely to include two methods of interven-
tion delivery: communicating with the pregnant womanFig. 1 The three approaches that informed the development of IMPRESS multicomponent behaviour change interventionSatyanarayana et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:74 Page 3 of 9
(non-smoker and the primary participant at the health
clinic) and with her husband (smoker and the secondary
participant) possibly through digital/mobile phone
technology.
In round 2, experts who participated in round 1 were
given feedback about the opinion of the whole group
(e.g. average rank assigned for each BCT) and asked to
re-evaluate their original ranking in view of this informa-
tion. This was repeated in the final round 3. On average,
two reminders were sent to the experts requesting them
to turn in their ratings of BCTs.
Qualitative interviews (detailed methods described
elsewhere [ 18])
Key informant interviews ( N= 64) were carried out with
pregnant women, husbands who smoked at home, hus-
bands who did not smoke at home, and family members
(parents, in-laws etc.) in India and Bangladesh to under-
stand contextual determinants of home exposure to
SHS, knowledge attitudes and SHS practices. The focus
of the interviews was the smoking behaviour of pregnant
women ’s husbands although details of other family
members ’smoking in the home also featured in partici-
pants ’accounts. Interviews were conducted in Comilla
(rural Bangladesh) and in Bangalore (urban India) to en-
sure relevance to both rural and urban settings.
Results
The detailed findings of the systematic review and quali-
tative interviews are published elsewhere [ 18,22]. How
these two studies informed the IMPRESS intervention
development is described below and in Table 1.
Systematic review
The review concluded that multicomponent behaviour
change interventions and their constituent education
and skills-based strategies (BCTs) appeared effective in
reducing SHS exposure during pregnancy. This informed
our decision to use a multicomponent behaviour change
intervention using BCTs. However, a small evidence
base and weak study methodology (self-reported expos-
ure, lack of objective outcome assessment, short follow-
up, absence of control group) prevented firm conclu-
sions about the specific BCTs to employ. Instead, 14
BCTS employed in the six intervention studies were in-
cluded in the list of 21 BCTs presented to experts in
round 1 of the Delphi survey (see Additional File 1).
Modified Delphi survey
In round 1 of the Delphi, of the 30 experts contacted, 17
experts (57% response rate) turned in their responses via
email. These 17 experts were contacted for round 2, of
whom 15 experts turned in their rankings (88% response
rate). In the final round, the same 15 experts turned intheir rankings (100% response rate). Consensus was
assessed using Kendall ’sWstatistics where < 0.5 indi-
cated poor consensus, 0.6 –0.8 indicated moderate con-
sensus and > 0.8 was strong consensus. Consensus
achieved in each round is summarized in Table 2.
The seven BCTs (see Table 1) that were most pre-
ferred by experts in round 3 were then used to guide the
development of the IMPRESS intervention.
Qualitative interviews
The interview findings were revisited to provide detail
for the seven selected BCTS as ingredients of the IMPR
ESS intervention components (see Table 1). As an ex-
ample, for the BCT ‘identify reasons/motives for wanting
and not wanting to stop smoking inside homes ’, preg-
nant women disliked the smell of smoke, felt nauseous
and wanted a smoke-free home for their own health and
that of their children/future child. Some husbands
wanted to quit smoking in their home to protect their
children and future child, although most liked smoking
in the comfort of their own home, surrounded by their
family. They did not want to be seen by others when
smoking outside and mentioned concerns about the
cold, insects, personal safety and being fined. The con-
sensus amongst pregnant women, husbands and family
members was that the husband ’s priority is his children
including the future child. This detail was used to de-
velop positive images of a smoke-free home highlighting
the cited benefits. In addition, feedback about the impact
of the husband ’s smoking in the home on his future
child directly targeted the husband.
Development of the intervention
The findings of the three studies described above were
discussed at an intervention development workshop in
Dhaka, Bangladesh (September 2016), where the re-
search team participated in intensive week-long delibera-
tions. During this workshop, three team members
leading one of the three studies presented their key find-
ings to the team. Following the presentations, relevant
findings from each of the three studies that informed
content and delivery were extracted through discussion
and consensus amongst team members was achieved
(resulting in Table 1).
A working draft of the content and delivery of our
proposed multicomponent IMPRESS intervention was
created and reviewed to ensure it could be feasible, scal-
able, sustainable, gender and culturally relevant and
cost-effective. An additional consideration was to ensure
that the intervention could be delivered to people with
low literacy. This was identified as a limitation in exist-
ing SHS interventions [ 21,22] and a priority for our tar-
get audience.Satyanarayana et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:74 Page 4 of 9

A team of illustrators, graphic designers and technol-
ogy partners were later involved to ensure that the con-
tent and delivery of health messages were impactful.
Intervention content
The four components of the IMPRESS multicomponent
behaviour change intervention are now described (see
Fig.2).
Picture booklet
The picture booklet titled “Clean air, healthy baby ”con-
sists of a combination of graphics and text description
on topics relevant to reduction of SHS at home. These
include but are not limited to (i) knowledge about SHS,
(ii) benefits of change, (iii) taking practical steps to re-
duce smoking at home and (iv) getting the help of
others, e.g. family members. It includes a page where the
pregnant woman and her husband agree to any three
commitments, they choose to make towards a smoke-
free home. The picture booklet also includes a pocket to
store the cotinine feedback report and letter from the fu-
ture child described below. It was developed in English
and translated to Kannada and Bengali for use in the
pilot RCT in India and Bangladesh.
Cotinine report
NICALERT, a quick saliva cotinine screening test for ex-
posure to SHS, is a standardized and reliable measure. A
saliva sample was collected from women in the antenatal
clinic using a funnel and collection container provided.
The NicAlertTM test device was laid on a dry flat sur-
face with the numbered levels facing up. The saliva sam-
ple was applied to the absorbent cotton wick end of the
test strip till it was completely saturated (usually 4 –5
drops). Results were read after 20 min. A level above 10
ng/ml indicates a positive test. Objective colour-coded
feedback about the presence of cotinine through the
NICALERT test is provided in the report.Letter from the future child
The letter from the future child is a rich narrative about
their exposure to SHS and its harmful effects on the
foetus and mother. This letter is addressed to the father
(who smokes at home).
Voice messages
Four automated voice messages are to be delivered as
per a standard schedule (weekly = 2, fortnightly = 1 and
monthly = 1) from the study office to the husband of the
pregnant woman. The automated voice messages remind
him to read the picture booklet if he has not done so
already and to take steps to make their home smoke
free.
Intervention delivery
One face-to-face session with the pregnant woman was
planned where the interventionist would briefly go
through the contents of the picture booklet. This picture
booklet (including the cotinine report and letter from
the future child) was subsequently given to the pregnant
woman to take home, encouraging her to share it with
her husband and family members. A week later, voice
messages were delivered to the husband as per the
above-described schedule.
Training of interventionists
Two research assistants with a Master ’s degree in psych-
ology/humanities delivered the intervention. A half-day
training package was developed. It comprised a brief ra-
tionale for the proposed intervention, overview of the
multicomponent intervention, do ’s and don ’ts in the
conduct of the intervention, and role plays. Some of the
skills and competencies imparted during training in-
cluded finding the right time and setting to negotiate a
smoke-free home, not engaging in blaming the husband
rather jointly taking steps to promote a smoke-free
home in the interest of the entire family. Specifically,Table 1 Multicomponent behaviour change intervention informed by the systematic review, modified Delphi survey and qualitative

communication and negotiation skills were the key
focus.
Discussion
BCTs are theory-informed and evidence-based strategies
aimed at enhancing positive health behaviours [ 23,32].
They have received widespread popularity and have an
evidence base in reducing smoking behaviours [ 31,33].
However, there is little research on behaviour change in-
terventions to reduce home exposure to SHS in preg-
nancy [ 21,22]. Consistent with recommendations [ 24,
25,32], we employed theory and evidence-based ap-
proach to detail the systematic development of our mul-
ticomponent behaviour change intervention (IMPRESS)
that was informed by a systematic review, modified Del-
phi survey and qualitative interviews with key infor-
mants. Whilst our approach is described as ‘theory and
evidence-based ’, it uses the philosophy of other ap-
proaches, namely, ‘target population centred ’,‘imple-
mentation based ’and ‘efficiency based ’[25]. IMPRESS is
also gender and culturally relevant. It is designed to em-
power the pregnant woman to be the main agent of
change of her husband ’s smoking behaviour whilst rec-
ognizing that this is a significant challenge in developing
and patriarchal countries [ 14,15,33].
IMPRESS comprised four components. Cotinine levels
in the pregnant women ’s saliva were measured as an ob-
jective indicator of SHS exposure. Feedback via an ‘offi-
cial ’cotinine report was designed to educate the
pregnant woman and her husband on the health risks ofhis smoking to the women and the future child. The let-
ter from the future child to the father was written to ap-
peal directly to the husband ’s motivation to protect his
children. The picture booklet was developed to increase
awareness about SHS and its harms; it also offered prac-
tical strategies to help the woman discuss smoking with
her husband and enlist help from supportive family
members to negotiate with her husband. It was simple
and self-explanatory to cater to the low literacy levels of
our sample but also to be visually appealing, to engage
the target audience. Finally, automated voice messages
were delivered to the husband to encourage him to read
the picture booklet and discuss with his wife how he
could take steps to make their home smoke free. Voice
messages have been under-utilized in SHS interventions
although m-health interventions are known to be cost-
effective, scalable and sustainable [ 21]. Voice messages
were used as opposed to text messages, due to the low
literacy level of our target population. They were also
considered to be more feasible than engaging with the
men in person.
The IMPRESS intervention package was designed to
be brief and easy to deliver by antenatal staff with min-
imal training to maximize its scalability and sustainabil-
ity. In line with WHO ’s directive, it could potentially be
integrated into routine antenatal care for screening and
intervention in these countries where the prevalence of
SHS is high [ 20].
In line with the MRC framework [ 24], the next step
was a pilot RCT to assess the acceptability and feasibility
Fig. 2 IMPRESS multicomponent behaviour change interventionSatyanarayana et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:74 Page 7 of 9
of the IMPRESS intervention in India and Bangladesh.
This has recently been completed. The results, to be
published soon, will inform plans to conduct a multi-
country definitive RCT.
Whilst our approach has many strengths as described
above, it also has limitations related to the modified Del-
phi survey. A moderate consensus amongst experts on
the most effective BCTs was achieved after three rounds.
This may be because the Delphi panel was heavily
skewed towards the UK experts. Although a high con-
sensus is desirable, a moderate one is acceptable in this
niche area where there is paucity of research on SHS
[31].
Conclusions
A theory and evidence-based approach informed the de-
velopment of a multicomponent behaviour change inter-
vention informed by a systematic review, modified
Delphi method and qualitative interviews. The interven-
tion has subsequently been evaluated in a pilot RCT for
its feasibility and acceptability in two LAMI countries,
India and Bangladesh, where the prevalence of home ex-
posure to SHS is high.
