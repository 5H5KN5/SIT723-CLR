Many individuals are motivated to improve their physical activity levels, but often
fail to act upon their intention. Interventions fostering volitional strategies,
such as action planning, coping planning, and self-eﬃcacy beliefs, can help totranslate intentions into behavior. This study examines the eﬀectiveness and
the mechanisms of a combined planning and self-eﬃcacy intervention to promote
physical activity among motivated individuals. Participants ( N¼883) were
randomly assigned to the intervention or to a waiting-list control condition.Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the intervention resulted in
signiﬁcantly more physical activity, higher levels of action planning, coping
planning, and volitional self-eﬃcacy beliefs ( p50.01). In addition, multiple
mediation analysis showed that action planning, coping planning, and volitionalself-eﬃcacy mediate between the intervention and physical activity. The study
shows that the intervention successfully fostered physical activity and unfolds the
underlying self-regulatory mechanisms of the intervention’s eﬀectiveness.

Introduction
Improving physical activity levels in the general population is one of the major aims
of health promotion programs to prevent noncommunicable diseases such asdiabetes, coronary heart diseases, and stroke (WHO, 2010). Besides preventing
cardiovascular diseases (Sesso, Paﬀenbarger, & Lee, 2000; Yusuf et al., 2004),
regular physical activity strengthens the immune defense (Smith, Kennedy, &Fleshner, 2004), reduces the risk of orthopedic problems and the risk of severalcancer sites (Friedenreich, Neilson, & Lynch, 2010). In addition, it has beneﬁcialeﬀects on mental health problems by preventing and reducing depression and anxiety(Mead et al., 2009; Salmon, 2001).
Even though the beneﬁcial eﬀects of physical activity are well established, and
many individuals have good intentions to be physically active, the majority fail to
take up or maintain an active lifestyle. This discrepancy between intention and

behavior is both a well-known problem of our daily life and a documented empirical
ﬁnding (known as ‘Intention-Behavior Gap’; (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006; Scholz,Schu¨z, Ziegelmann, Lippke, & Schwarzer, 2008; Schwarzer, 2008; Sheeran, 2002;
Sniehotta, Scholz, & Schwarzer, 2005). Social cognitive theories, such as the theory
of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991), postulate on the one hand that intentions are
good predictors of behavior, but, on the other, interventions based on such theoriesare not very eﬀective in increasing health behaviors (Chatzisarantis & Hagger, 2005;Hardeman et al., 2002; Kinmonth et al., 2008). Therefore, recent research oninterventions has focused on volitional (postintentional) processes (Armitage &Arden, 2010), such as planning (Gollwitzer, 1999) or self-eﬃcacy beliefs (Bandura,1991).
Planning interventions have been found to be eﬀective in increasing health
behavior habits. Several meta-analyses have summarized the eﬀects of these
interventions (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006). However, some studies failed to ﬁndeﬀects of planning interventions on health behavior (Jackson et al., 2005; Michie,Dormandy, & Marteau, 2004). Evidence from intervention studies revealed thatplanning is only beneﬁcial for individuals who explicitly intend to change theirbehavior (Lippke, Ziegelmann, & Schwarzer, 2004) or for those people who harboroptimistic self-beliefs when overcoming temptations or when adopting a new courseof action (Luszczynska & Haynes, 2009). Thus, for those participants who intend to
change, it seems to be useful to combine planning and self-eﬃcacy interventions to
foster changes in health behavior.
One can distinguish between action planning and coping planning. Action
planning refers to plans regarding the initiation of health behavior, as it might helpto translate intentions into speciﬁc action by specifying the ‘‘when,’’ ‘‘where,’’ and‘‘how’’ to perform a desired action (Norman & Conner, 2005; Scholz et al., 2008;Sniehotta, 2009; Wiedemann, Lippke, Reuter, Ziegelmann, & Schu ¨z, 2011). In
contrast, the term coping planning refers to dealing with barriers that may impede
the maintenance of a health behavior (Sniehotta, 2009). Both types of planning are
important components of volitional interventions.
Diﬀerent challenges have to be met during the course of physical activity change,
and self-eﬃcacy is required to master these tasks successfully (Luszczynska &Tryburcy, 2008). Volitional self-eﬃcacy describes optimistic self-beliefs concerningthe ability to cope with the experience of possible failure and recovery from relapses.It is, thus, most important when it comes to resuming an interrupted behavioralchain in the direction of the behavioral intention. The eﬀects of volitional self-
eﬃcacy on behavior change have been examined in several studies (Scholz,
Sniehotta, & Schwarzer, 2005; Schwarzer, 2008).
Showing how or why an intervention works is as important as providing the
evidence that it works (Michie & Abraham, 2004). A large body of evidence suggeststhat enhancing self-eﬃcacy and planning results in increased physical activity(Allison & Keller, 2004; Luszczynska, 2006; Ziegelmann, Lippke, & Schwarzer,2006). Interventions work, for example, by enhancing social cognitions that, inturn, facilitate behavior change. Mediation analysis might unfold the underlying
working mechanisms of an eﬀective intervention (Lippke, Schwarzer, Ziegelmann,
Scholz, & Schu ¨z, 2010). In order to examine whether an increase in physical activity
can be attributed to higher levels of self-reported self-eﬃcacy, action planning,or coping planning, these three factors can be speciﬁed in a multiple mediationmodel.Psychology, Health & Medicine 489
Aim of the study
We investigated the eﬀectiveness and the working mechanisms of a combined
planning and self-eﬃcacy intervention. Hypotheses were that participants of theintervention, as compared to participants in the waiting-list control condition,would report higher levels of physical activity, action planning, coping planning, andvolitional self-eﬃcacy after three weeks (Hypothesis 1). Furthermore, we assumedthat group diﬀerences in physical activity would be mediated by diﬀerences in actionplanning, coping planning, and volitional self-eﬃcacy (Hypothesis 2).
Method
Procedure
We conducted an online intervention designed to promote physical activity in
Germany. Data collection started in December 2009 and ended in September 2010.Participants were recruited by press releases (radio, newspaper, TV) with a link tothe study website. This study was a randomized controlled trial with only one
measurement point in time, following the treatment in the intervention group and
preceding the treatment in the control group. Participants ( N¼2839) gave informed
consent and provided email addresses. Afterwards, they were randomized to anintervention group or a waiting-list control group. The intervention group received avolitional treatment that lasted on average 45 min. After three weeks, they wereinvited by email to an on-line follow-up assessment that took about 15 min. Thecontrol group underwent the same follow-up assessment after three weeks, andparticipants received the volitional treatment afterwards. Participants of the control
group were told that they were randomized to a waiting condition and that they will
be approached three weeks later. A subsample of 883 individuals revisited thewebsite and completed the follow-up assessments (31.1% of initial contacts).
The study adhered to American Psychological Association’s ethical principles
regarding research with human participants and to guidelines for internet research(Michalak & Szabo, 1998).
Participants
The ﬁnal sample consisted of 883 participants (600 women and 283 men), with a
mean age of 43.2 years, SD¼13.5, ranging from 16 to 76 years. The sample consisted
of 445 individuals in the intervention group and 438 in the control group (seeTable 1). A randomization check revealed no diﬀerences between the control andthe intervention group participants regarding age, F(1881)¼0.97, p40.05, and sex,

Measures
Physical activity was assessed by using a part of the International Physical Activity
Questionnaire (IPAQ) (Craig et al., 2003). The IPAQ has acceptable measurementproperties (test–retest reliability: Spearman’s r¼0.8, criterion validity: r¼0.30).
Respondents were asked to indicate the frequency of performed moderate and
strenuous physical activity within the last week. Furthermore, they were asked to490 M. Koring et al.
state how much time they had spent performing these activities on average per
session (duration). The assessment of physical activity frequency was provided as apull-down menu, allowing responses from zero toseven days . The average physical
activity duration was measured with speciﬁed responses from zero tothree-hundred
or more minutes a day . Frequency and duration of physical activity were multiplied
to obtain a sum score of physical activity during the last week.
The items to assess intention were worded in analogy to the items measuring
physical activity in order to obtain a correspondence of speciﬁcity levels: ‘‘How often
do you intend to be physically active in the following week?’’ and ‘‘How long do youintend to be physically active on such an occasion on average?’’ Both items had openanswer formats.
The following variables were measured with six-point Likert scale, ranging from
(1)totally disagree to (6) totally agree as response format.
Action planning was assessed with four items, a¼0.86. The stem item ‘‘I have
already planned . . .’’ was followed by the statements ‘‘. . . which kind of physical
activity I want to exert,’’ ‘‘. . . when I want to be physically active,’’ ‘‘. . . where I want
to be physically active,’’ and ‘‘. . . how long I want to be physically active.’’
Coping planning was assessed with three items, a¼0.89, for example, ‘‘I have
made a detailed plan regarding what to do when something interferes with myplans.’’ This planning assessment has been found to predict behavior change(Lippke, Ziegelmann, Schwarzer, & Velicer, 2009; Scholz et al., 2008).
Volitional self-eﬃcacy was assessed with four items, a¼0.85. The stem was ‘‘I am
conﬁdent that I can resume a physically active lifestyle . . .’’ The second part of the
item was worded, such as ‘‘. . . even if I have already postponed my concrete plans a
couple of times’’ or ‘‘. . . even if I have not exercised for some weeks.’’ The scale hasbeen used successfully in numerous previous studies (Scholz et al., 2008; Schwarzer &Luszczynska, 2007).

Intervention
It was assumed that voluntary participants of an on-line intervention fostering
physical activity are a highly motivated subpopulation of the general public.
Therefore, we assumed that it was adequate to concentrate on a volitional
intervention that focuses on the realization of intentions and plans. The interventionwas based on previous interventions (Lippke et al., 2010; Ziegelmann et al., 2006),but was slightly changed in terms of design and operationalization of constructs.It consisted of diﬀerent behavior change techniques (Abraham & Michie, 2008).
The action planning part of the intervention started with goal commitment. The
participants were asked to commit to a speciﬁc physical activity goal. Role modelsgave tips on what to consider when initiating a new behavior and provided examples
of diﬀerent subgoals. Depending on the diﬀerence between actual and target level of
physical activity, a graded task was set: Participants were asked to set a personalsubgoal and a corresponding deadline that would lead to the activity end goal. Theactual action planning intervention comprised a page with a calendar for one week.Participants were prompted to specify opportunities (where and when) for their goaland occasions for preparatory behavior. After common situations were identiﬁedthat posed a challenge and solutions were provided to overcome the obstacles,individuals were invited to write up to three personal barriers and to ﬁnd strategies
to overcome those barriers. The part of the intervention fostering volitional self-
eﬃcacy comprised a page were role models reported about their success in adoptingan active lifestyle and in recovering from relapses. Moreover, participants wereprompted to focus on past success and instructed to reattribute reasons for their pastfailure in a favorable manner.
Analytical procedure
All analyses were run with SPSS 17.0. Hypothesis 1 was tested with multivariate
analysis of variance (MANOVA) and a chi-square test. Hypothesis 2 on the multiplemediator models was performed using an SPSS macro (Preacher & Hayes, 2008).This procedure was favored over the commonly used simple mediation analysis (e.g.Sobel–Goodman test) mainly because (a) running simple mediation analyses forevery potential mediator individually increases the probability of Type-I errors,(b) the multiple mediator models allow to use bootstrapping, a nonparametricresampling procedure that does not impose the assumption of normality of the
sampling distribution (Preacher & Hayes, 2008), and (c) multiple mediator analysis
allows testing of the signiﬁcance of indirect eﬀects directly. Bootstrapping wasapplied with conﬁdence intervals (CIs) generated from 5000 resamples (MacKinnon,Lockwood, & Williams, 2004). Missing data were imputed using the ExpectationMaximization Algorithm in SPSS (Enders, 2001).
Results
Mean level analyses
The intervention group scored higher in physical activity, both in terms of frequency
per week and in terms of minutes per week, than the control group. Statistics areillustrated in Table 1. Additional w
2tests revealed a signiﬁcant association between
the condition (intervention or control group) and whether or not participants would492 M. Koring et al.
meet the recommendations criterion of the WHO (2010) of 5 630 min of physical
activity per week, w2(1)¼81.63, p50.001, odds ratio ¼2.6. Thus, the chance of
treated individuals to be physically active at a suﬃcient level is 2.6 times higher thanthe chance of those who did not yet receive the intervention.
Multivariate analysis of variance: Intervention eﬀects on physical activity and
psychological variables
To test the eﬀects of the intervention, a MANOVA was run with condition
(volitional intervention vs. control condition) as independent variable, and physicalactivity, action planning, coping planning, and volitional self-eﬃcacy as dependentvariables. Pillai’s trace indicates an overall signiﬁcant eﬀect of the intervention on
physical activity, action planning, coping planning, and volitional self-eﬃcacy,

subject eﬀects revealed signiﬁcant group diﬀerences in every single one of thedependent variables, namely in the direction of higher levels in the interventiongroup: physical activity, F(1,883) ¼10.62, p50.01, Z

Multiple mediation analysis
The previous analyses have demonstrated signiﬁcant between-group diﬀerences in
physical activity, action and coping planning, and volitional self-eﬃcacy. To testwhether the diﬀerences in physical activity could be ascribed to diﬀerences in thepsychological variables that were addressed in the intervention, a multiple mediationanalysis with condition (volitional intervention vs. control condition) as independentvariable; action planning, coping planning, and volitional self-eﬃcacy as mediator
variables; and physical activity as dependent variable was conducted, controlling for
sex and age. Figure 1 displays the results of the model. In this model, condition wassigniﬁcantly related to the mediator variables and physical activity: action planning,b¼0.19, p50.01, coping planning, b¼0.34, p50.01, volitional self-eﬃcacy,
b¼0.09, p50.01, physical activity, b¼0.11, p50.01. Moreover, the mediators

were signiﬁcantly related to the dependent variable: action planning, b¼0.15,
p50.01, coping planning, b¼0.13, p50.01, volitional self-eﬃcacy, b¼0.15,
p50.01. After controlling for the mediators, the direct eﬀect of the condition
on physical activity was no longer signiﬁcant, b¼0.02, p40.01. Bootstrapping
revealed the largest indirect eﬀect of the condition on physical activity through
coping planning (0.08), then action planning (0.06), and a smaller indirect eﬀect ofvolitional self-eﬃcacy (0.03). With this model, 13% of variance in physical activitywas accounted for.
Discussion
An intervention targeting action planning, coping planning and volitional self-
eﬃcacy beliefs resulted in an increase in physical activity after three weeks. All
dependent variables turned out to be superior in the intervention group. A furtherquestion was whether these variables constitute multiple outcomes of theintervention, or whether they might reﬂect the ingredients of the interventionpackage and would, thus, operate as causal agents for behavior change. To examinethe mechanisms of behavior change, we applied multiple mediation analyses byspecifying a path model where planning and self-eﬃcacy served as mediatorsbetween group membership and physical activity. Such an analysis is likely to shed
light on the way these variables might have operated in the study. The intervention
eﬀect was mediated by respective cognitions. The instructions on the planning andthe fostering of self-eﬃcacy had an eﬀect on the respective cognitions, and thecognitions enabled participants in the intervention group to increase their physicalactivity level.
Between-group diﬀerences in action planning, coping planning, and volitional
self-eﬃcacy beliefs mediated the eﬀects of the combined intervention on physicalactivity. Findings support previous research on interventions (Allison & Keller,
2004; Calfas, Sallis, Oldenburg, & Ffrench, 1997) fostering physical activity, namely
that an enhancement of self-eﬃcacy may result in behavior change. Results are alsoin line with studies demonstrating that planning physical activity may work becauseit encourages individuals to engage in more frequent use of strategic planning(Luszczynska, 2006; Luszczynska, Sobczyk, & Abraham, 2007).
Furthermore, with the results of our study, previous ﬁndings in the ﬁeld of
dietary behavior could be replicated for the domain of physical activity. A study byLuszczynska et al. (2007) showed that a combined self-eﬃcacy and planning
intervention was successful in increasing fruit and vegetable intake and that the
intervention eﬀects were mediated by changes in self-eﬃcacy beliefs and planningbehavior.
The inclusion of both action planning and coping planning might also have
added to the intervention’s eﬀectiveness. Research on action planning and copingplanning interventions (Sniehotta, Scholz, & Schwarzer, 2006) revealed thatinterventions fostering both planning facets are more eﬀective than interventionsonly stimulating the generation of action plans. The multiple mediation model that
diﬀerentiated between action and coping planning demonstrated that both facets
contributed uniquely to the explained variance.
Combined planning and self-eﬃcacy interventions promoting physical activity
might have implications for diﬀerent health outcomes, mediated by increases inphysical activity, as in our study, the number of individuals meeting the WHO (2010)494 M. Koring et al.
recommendation was 2.6 times higher in the intervention group than in the control
group. A dose-response relationship between physical activity and cardiovasculardiseases and coronary heart diseases has been found (Nocon et al., 2008; Soﬁ,Capalbo, Cesari, Abbate, & Gensini, 2008), suggesting that a notable risk reduction
occurs at levels of 150 min of activity per week. Similar quantitative relations have
been detected for physical activity and diabetes (Warburton, Katzmarzyk, Rhodes,& Shephard, 2007), physical activity and increases in bone mass density (Scerpella,Davenport, Morganti, Kanaley, & Johnson, 2003), and for weight maintenance(Cook, Alberts, & Lambert, 2008).
Some limitations are to be mentioned. In spite of the experimental design, the data
analyzed in this study are cross-sectional, as there was only one measurement point intime, following the treatment in the intervention group and preceding the treatment in
the control group. Thus, the relationship of action planning, coping planning, and
volitional self-eﬃcacy with physical activity can be interpreted as bidirectional. Thespeciﬁcation of the social-cognitive variables as predictors of behavior is not the onlypossible explanation of the correlations. Furthermore, the amount of varianceaccounted for in the multiple mediation model was only moderate (13%). This ﬁndingunderlines that other predictors that were not speciﬁed in our model may contribute tothe physical activity levels, e.g. previous physical activity.
We implemented the cross-sectional randomized design to avoid mere-measure-
ment eﬀects (Morwitz, Johnson, & Schmittlein, 1993) of a pretest. On the one hand,
the design might be regarded as a shortcoming of our study, because we were notable to control for baseline diﬀerences between the groups and for a systematicdropout. On the other hand, the randomized no-pretest design has advantages inwarranting that neither the intervention group nor the control group is sensitizedto physical activity by a pretest. This might have increased the probability ofidentifying intervention eﬀects. In a recent study (Godin, Belanger-Gravel,Amireault, Vohl, & Perusse, 2011), it was found that completing a questionnaire
on cognitions regarding physical activity had a positive eﬀect on subsequent practice
of physical activity.
Another limitation of our study might be that the participants were not blinded
to the condition they were randomized to. That might have had a negative impact onthe motivation of control group participants and thereby might have led to anoverestimation of the intervention’s eﬀectiveness.
Moreover, the data of our study are based on self-reports. Although the validity
of self-reports seems to be acceptable (Armitage & Conner, 2001; Godin, Jobin, &
Bouillon, 1986; Miller, Freedson, & Kline, 1994), supplementation by objective
measures of physical activity is desirable (e.g. using pedometers or electronictracking data).
Nevertheless, this theory-guided experimental design has elucidated the
mechanisms of activity change. The ﬁndings replicate similar studies with diﬀerenthealth behaviors and, thus, make a contribution to our cumulative knowledge onpsychological components in health behavior changes.
