Abstract
Background: This paper reports how we used a realist review, as part of a wider project to improve collaborative
mental health care for prisoners with common mental health problems, to develop a conceptual platform. The
importance of offenders gaining support for their mental health, and the need for practitioners across the health
service, the criminal justice system, and the third sector to work together to achieve this is recognised internationally.
However, the literature does not provide coherent analyses of how these ambitions can be achieved. This paper
demonstrates how a realist review can be applied to inform complex intervention development that spans different
locations, organisations, professions, and care sectors.
Methods: We applied and developed a realist review for the purposes of intervention development, using a
three-stage process. (1) An iterative database search st rategy (extending beyond criminal justice and offender
health) and groups of academics, practitioners, and people with lived experience were used to identify explanatory
accounts ( n= 347). (2) From these accounts, we developed consolidated explanatory accounts ( n= 75). (3) The
identified interactions between practitioners and offenders (within their organisational, social, and cultural contexts)
were specified in a conceptual platform. We also specify, step by step, how these explanatory accounts were
documented, consolidated, and built into a conceptual platform. This addresses an important methodological gap for
social scientists and intervention developers about how to develop and articulate programme and implementation
theory underpinning complex interventions.
Results: An integrated person-centred system is proposed to improve collaborative mental health care for offenders
with common mental health problems (near to and after release) by achieving consistency between the goals of
different sectors and practitioners, enabling practitioners to apply scientific and experiential knowledge in working
judiciously and reflectively, and building systems and aligning resources that are centred on offenders ’health and
social care needs.
Conclusions: As part of a broader programme of work, a realist review can make an important contribution to the
specification of theoretically informed interventions that have the potential to improve health outcomes. Our
conceptual platform has potential application in related systems of health and social care where integrated, and
person-centred care is a goal.

Background
This paper reports how we used a realist review, which
aims to produce explanations of why mechanisms produce
different patterns of outcomes in different contexts [1, 2],
to develop a ‘conceptual platform ’specifying how an in-
tegrated, person-centred system to improve the mental
health of offenders with common mental health problems
is proposed to work. In realist terminology, a conceptual
platform identifies the core set of processes within a class
of interventions, how these processes operate, and the
interactions between them [3]. In doing so, conceptual
platforms have the potential to significantly increase the
efficiency of intervention development and evaluation by
providing a ‘recyclable ’core set of processes that can be
judiciously applied in related areas [3]. In the example
reported here, the conceptual platform is feeding into a
wider project to develop, implement, and trial an inter-
vention to improve collaborative mental health care for

view addresses the call for complex interventions with
multiple, synergistic components, and which interact with
context [4], to be properly theorised [5, 6].
Our use of a realist review is methodologically novel
as it was conducted in parallel with the timelines and
methods of a wider research project so as to inform inter-
vention development. It therefore focused on extensive
theory-building and refinement rather than the evaluation
of these theories. In contrast to the use of social-
psychological theory to inform the design of primary
research that identifies and m aps behavioural barriers to
theoretical domains in clinic al settings, for example, [7 –10],
this paper demonstrates how a realist review can be ap-
plied to inform complex intervention development that
spans different locations, organisations, professions, and
care sectors and incorporates organisational processes and
practitioners ’interactions. To enable careful reflection
and critique about how this may be achieved in prac-
tice, we provide considerable methodological detail.
International and national policies [11, 12] and guide-
lines [13] stress that a greater degree of integration be-
tween criminal justice, health, and social care systems is
desirable to improve the mental health care for offenders,
particularly in maintaining access to mental health care
when prisoners are released into the community. How-
ever, the scientific literature does not provide coherent
analyses of how this integration, in the form of collab-
orative care, can be achieved [14 –16]. Prisoners with
anxiety and depression (common mental health problems)
may be impulsive and at risk of self-harm and returning to
substance use after their release. Our prior hypothesis was
that collaborative care for such prison leavers should in-
clude a number of components including the following:
therapy; medication; ‘through the gate ’interaction with a
link worker; resettlement such as housing, training, oremployment support; and/or rehabilitation to change
motivation or attitudes.
Our aim was to articulate, at both the organisational
and individual levels, how an integrated, person-centred
system that spans criminal justice and (mental) health
and social inclusion service delivery is proposed to lead
to improved outcomes. We applied a realist review in a
novel way by focusing on the identification, articulation,
and consolidation of explanatory accounts in order to
inform intervention development. These explanatory ac-
counts are analogous to ‘programme theory ’in that they
express ideas about how a problem can best be addressed
[17]. They can be seen as the ‘building blocks ’of broader,
integrated theory about complex interventions. As such,
they are large in number and cover a broad range of
issues, including in this case the behaviour of different
groups of individuals, how systems of care are organised
between different sectors, and how organisational or com-
munity contexts enable or inhibit interactions or behav-
iour. We began by identifying over 300 such accounts,
subsequently reducing them to 75 ‘consolidated ’explana-
tory accounts. Wherever possible, explanatory accounts
made reference to the enabling and constraining factors
(context) that impact on the operation of mechanisms
and lead to outcomes (in realist terminology, context-
mechanism-outcome configurations).
The explanatory accounts enabled us to produce a con-
ceptual platform which will inform, together with analyses
from focus groups and case studies, the development of
an intervention that will be evaluated in a randomised-
controlled trial (which is ongoing). We drew on sources
beyond the fields of criminal justice and offender health
(i.e. relating to other vulnerable populations) to develop
explanatory accounts of context-mechanism-outcome
configurations. As our goal in the review was to improve
understanding of causal mechanisms across the system
as a whole by specifying how multiple stakeholders under-
stand and interact within it, our identification of ex-
planatory accounts was therefore not limited to formal
academic theory —indeed, the accounts of offenders, their
families, and practitioners were crucial to understanding
the operation of the system as a whole.
We conceptualised the proposed intervention as involv-
ing two steps, engaging first with practitioners (and the
environment in which they work). Practitioners would
then, through their changed behaviour and actions, en-
gage with and support offenders in new and more effective
ways. This conceptualisation was based on our previous
experience and knowledge of working and researching
with offenders. The intervention would bring about its ef-
fects by first influencing the organisational opportunities
and constraints. This would enable practitioners to change
their behaviour, which in turn could then influence
offenders ’behaviour (whilst taking account of theirPearson et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:134 Page 2 of 12
motivations and capabilities) [18]. This approach com-
bines realist and behaviour change approaches and is
also consonant with the World Health Organization ’s
‘roadmap ’for people-centred health systems [19]. We
proposed that intervention practitioners would work with
individual offenders for a time-limited ‘pathway ’based on
identification prior to release, support ‘through the prison
gate’, and support in the community. We envisaged that
the intervention would be judiciously modifiable to local
contexts; link to, and support, co-ordination of existing re-
sources (rather than being a stand-alone, all-encompassing
service); and provide some form of ongoing care and sup-
port (rather than primarily having a triage and referral
function as is currently adv ocated [20]). Whilst we did
not envisage the intervention involving structural change
within prisons [21, 22], we did envisage that it would re-
quire some changes to the operating environment to sup-
port specific practitioner behaviours. It was also based on
the need to overcome the fundamental deficit in prisons
whereby mental health issues remain unrecognised and
unaddressed [15].
In summary, our aim was to articulate, at both organ-
isational and individual levels, how an integrated, person-
centred system that spans criminal justice and (mental)
health and social inclusion service delivery is proposed to
lead to improved outcomes. In the following pages, we
document how we applied the realist review, including the
identification and consolidation of explanatory accounts.
The findings are presented as a narrative description of
the conceptual platform and its relation to the structure of
the envisaged intervention.
Methods
A realist review [1] is grounded in a realist philosophy of sci-
ence which holds that it is possible to discern generative
mechanisms within the social systems in which they operate
[23, 24]. It is characterised by taking an iterative approach to
the identification, appraisal, and synthesis of diverse forms
of evidence in the form of programme theories. The aim is
to explain how mechanisms (the way in which a pro-
gramme ’s resources or opportunities interact with the rea-
soning of individuals and lead to changes in behaviour [25])
produce different patterns of outcomes in different contexts
(the wider configuration of factors that enable or constrain
the operation of mechanisms) [1, 2]. The full protocol for
the review, which includes the initial ‘two-step ’conceptual-
isation of the intervention and programme theory, is regis-
tered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42012002640). The
review is reported in accordance with the RAMESES
publication standards for realist reviews [26].
Search strategy
The search strategy was designed to locate and retrieve
relevant information from a range of published andunpublished sources. This strategy, informed by the for-
mative models presented in the protocol, started with
hand-searching a core set of 16 journals to identify
sources that could inform citation chasing, website and
database searches, and elicitation from experts (including
academics, practitioners, and men with lived experience of
prison and release (referred to as peer researchers)). Our
searches were developed iteratively and explicitly included
sources from a range of fiel ds so that learning from
criminal justice, mental health care, and health and social
inclusion service delivery to vulnerable groups could be
incorporated. We conducted the search strategy in stages,
progressing from searches focusing on offenders, to vul-
nerable groups, and then to mental health. Full details of
the search strategy are reported in Additional file 1.
Screening
We first included all sources that provided rich descrip-
tions (see criteria in Additional file 2) of the content and
delivery of interventions that proposed a form of collab-
orative care for offenders with common mental health
problems in any Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) country orthat proposed ways
in which intervention components or service configura-
tions achieve, or could achieve, positive outcomes. Sources
eligible for inclusion included (but were not limited to)
editorials, opinion pieces, commentaries, comparative
effectiveness studies, process evaluations, qualitative re-
search, and systematic reviews. In screening, we erred on
the side of inclusivity so that components of less holistic
forms of collaborative care could still contribute explana-
tory accounts.
Where insufficient sources relating to offenders were
located to enable identification of explanatory accounts,
we translated these inclusion criteria to the screening of
sources about vulnerable groups, and then mental health.
In applying the inclusion criteria, we were aware of the risk
of excluding relevant sources if applied mechanistically —we
therefore operationalised our inclusion criteria in the form
of whether or not sources contained or tested theories that
addressed any of the components in the initial model pro-
posed in our protocol. This also facilitated the screening of
sources not directly related to the care of offenders.
To inform decision-making in the review, we produced
a‘map’of all sources identified for potential inclusion
through classifying the sources by topic, type of publi-
cation, and whether professional or lived experience of
people were the source of the explanatory accounts.
We also classified all sources by relevance (potential
contribution to building explanatory accounts) and ‘rigour ’
(Additional file 2).
We acknowledge that limits to the extent and depth of
information contained in abstracts placed constraints on
the accuracy to which we could classify sources. WePearson et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:134 Page 3 of 12
therefore erred on the side of caution and included sources
where it was not possible to establish clearly whether or

should be classified. The flow of sources through the

Identifying explanatory accounts
We located explanatory accounts in a range of sources
(primary studies, opinion pieces, grey literature) and in a
range of locations within sources, such as study findings
and researchers ’reflections. Explanatory accounts were
also identified at a meeting with a peer researcher group
of men with lived experience of prison and release (as
part of a series of 18 group meetings) and a study group
of practitioners and academics (which met once during
the review and subsequently corresponded by email).
We used Jackson et al. ’s [27] strategy for identifying ex-
planatory accounts by ‘working backwards ’from outcomes,
both intermediate and final and personal or organisational.
Frequent interaction between the two reviewers (MP
and SB) took place to enable consistency of application
and to address ongoing issues with the application of the
strategy.
Identified explanatory accounts were recorded in a table
together with a record of the source (academic, practitioner,
peer researcher, offender, sign ificant other of offender, or
policy maker —see Additional file 3). Wherever possible, we
expressed explanatory accounts in the form of ‘If…then’
statements which specified context and mechanism. For
example: Ifyoung homeless people have a deep mistrust
of services from their experiences in childhood, then theirtrust in, and engagement with, services in adult life is se-
verely limited (#52). However, we did not limit accounts
to only those that could be expressed in this way as we
recognised that partial accounts about context could still
be informative. For example: Many prisoners were less
willing to remain in services on release —in prison, the ser-
vice had filled their day, but in the community, there were
so many other factors affecting their lives (#103). The
table enabled both reviewers to comment on and identify
inter-relationships and overlaps between explanatory ac-
counts before further development.
To maintain a balance between comprehensiveness and
achievable review outputs, we did not record explanatory
accounts that substantively repeated or overlapped with
earlier accounts but did retain these sources for potential
later use. Additional file 3 lists the 347 explanatory ac-
counts located.
Consolidating and expressing explanatory accounts
We aimed to integrate explanatory accounts in order to
produce the most economical expression of context-
mechanism-outcome configurations. We initially tried
to synthesise using all of the processes of reasoning
(juxtaposition, reconciliation, adjudication, consolidation,
and situating) suggested by Pawson [1], but given the
breadth and complexity of the explanatory accounts, we
found this process unwieldy and problematic to docu-
ment. Instead, we structured our synthesis using a set of
questions (below) that focused on the mechanism or out-
come within explanatory accounts.

We (MP and SB) agreed on an initial classification of
the explanatory accounts according to the components
of our initial model [28]. We jointly read the explanatory
accounts, for each one asking the following:
/C15Is this account novel? (and therefore reasonable to
‘import ’directly into the consolidated explanatory
accounts table)
If the account was not entirely novel, then our discussion
was prompted by asking the following questions:
/C15Does this account challenge the explanations made
in related accounts?
/C15Does this account add important refinements to the
understanding of contexts, mechanisms, or outcomes
made in related accounts?
To e xpress the consolidated accounts, we asked the
following questions:
/C15Is an aspect of an account novel and therefore possible
to transfer verbatim to a consolidated account?
/C15Is a context, mechanism, or outcome sufficiently
similar to that in a consolidated account to warrant
integration into that account under a different term?
Or should the consolidated account be changed to
reflect the new term and the increased explanatory
power it offers?
/C15Does the revised consolidated explanatory account
sufficiently reflect the context-mechanism-outcome
configurations proposed in the underlying explanatory
accounts?
This process of synthesis hinged upon the openness and
commitment of the reviewers (MP and SB) to purposefully
challenge the developing consolidated explanatory ac-
counts. Central to this was a working relationship that val-
ued constructive debate and which made time for the
investigation and resolution of disagreements. Two worked
examples of consolidating by mechanism and outcome are
s h o w ni nt h ea n i m a t i o na n dn a r r a t i o ni nA d d i t i o n a lf i l e4 .
During the synthesis process, we shared a selection of
the consolidated explanatory accounts with our expert
group of practitioners and academics so that feedback
about their expression and scope could be incorporated.
Additional file 5 lists the 75 consolidated explanatory ac-
counts, which were classified by the type of context or
interaction so as to facilitate the use of the accounts in
intervention development. The sources from which the
consolidated explanatory accounts were developed are
shown in Additional file 6.
We developed the conceptual platform, which is de-
scribed narratively in the ‘Findings ’section below andsummarised in bullet points at the end, with a view to
the eventual intervention being a two-stage process. This
involves engaging first with practitioners (and the envir-
onment in which they work) so that they can then,
through their changed behaviour and actions, engage with
offenders. We envisaged this two-stage process involving
feedback loops, emergence, and non-linearity.
Findings
An overview of how the conceptual platform is integrated
with the structure of the envisaged intervention is shown
in Fig. 2. The three columns delineate different key inter-
actions over time, before and after release, whilst partici-
pating in a mental health improvement intervention.
Dashed lines bound the interactions during which
mechanisms activate. These contextualised interactions
can be between practitioners and offenders, between
the practitioner/offender and other practitioners, or be-
tween the offender and family members, peers, or men-
tors. At the focal point of the intervention are the core
interactions between intervention practitioners and of-
fenders. It is within these interactions that the effect of
the intervention on practitioners ’behaviour, thinking,
and emotion has the potential to affect offenders ’behav-
iour, thinking, and emotion. In between these core interac-
tions, the interactions of both the practitioner and offender
with other people (the central three circles in the graphic)
affect change in their behaviour, thinking, and emotions
and how these interact with their contexts. These changes
impact on the subsequent interaction between the prac-
titioner and offender and generate other potentially bene-
ficial effects.
Categories within the semi-circles show the headings
under which the 75 consolidated explanatory accounts
(referred to in parentheses; listed in Additional file 4)
are presented below. The narrative below presents the
conceptual platform for how an intervention to promote
mental health across institutional and community envi-
ronments theoretically operates.
Practitioners —organisational context
Practitioners work within organisations, and the day-to-
day operation of organisations impacts on the extent to
which practitioners can deliver services that are person-
centred. If there is congruence between the goals and
values of practitioners and the organisation in which
they work, then the resources provided by the inter-
vention are more likely to be used in the way intended
(consolidated explanatory a ccounts 43, 61). However,
as delivery of a person-centred intervention is dependent
upon different organisations working together collabora-
tively, the infrastructure to support practitioners ’work is
key. At a strategic level, attaining agreement between or-
ganisations about common purpose is a necessary firstPearson et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:134 Page 5 of 12
step (1, 61) but is insufficient without the practical ele-
ments that enable these to be achieved day to day. Such
elements can include pooled budgets (56) and collab-
oratively developed formal agreements about informa-
tion sharing, assessment tools, roles, and responsibilities
(1, 52) and the authority to hold practitioners in other or-
ganisations to account (52, 58). At an operational level,
practitioners need to be given the opportunity to develop
their skills (for example, in relation to trauma and
self-harm (39, 50)) and have their practice supported
by organisational systems that both enable monitoring
of individuals in need of care and provide feedback and
support that facilitates practitioners ’skill development (39).
Maintaining congruence at both strategic and practi-
tioner levels is vital. An agreement developed betweenorganisations at a strategic level risks piecemeal imple-
mentation if it is not congruent with the goals and values
of practitioners (61). Organisational agreements do not
function solely through their formal status but because
they are seen as relevant and workable by practitioners
across different organisations. The development of work-
ing relationships that can support this inter-organisational
congruence may be facilitated by basing practitioners in
the same location (53).
Practitioners —social/cultural context
Practitioners rarely consciously decide to work in a non-
collaborative way, but non-collaborative practice can arise
from the decisions that practitioners make within the
organisational and incentive structures, and cultural

contexts, in which they work. Collaborative practice can
therefore be supported through a range of facilitative
organisational measures. If practitioners understand their
role, responsibilities, and the contribution that they make
within a system of care and around a particular offender,
they are more likely to be able and willing to work col-
laboratively (25). Clear agreements between organisa-
tions about these factors, together with the information
and communication systems that enable them to be put
into practice, are also necessary but not sufficient on
their own (2, 25).
Interactions between practitioners and practitioners
Information-sharing and care planning (for the delivery
of collaborative care) is not a passive process of diffusion
between practitioners working in different locations or
care sectors. Even though communication systems and
inter-organisational agreemen ts may facilitate information-
sharing and care planning (52), they do not eclipse the
importance of practitioners ’working relationships both
within and beyond their immediate working environment.
Collaborative working between practitioners therefore has
arelational aspect but also a knowing aspect about the op-
eration of the care system as a whole. These aspects are
mutually reinforcing —for example, knowing who to con-
tact and how is insufficient without a practitioner believing
that his/her referral will be welcomed (2). A referral that is
welcomed provides an opportunity for relationship build-
ing (17, 22). Referrals, training, and supervision can sup-
port development of a shared language (24) and greater
understanding of the care system as a whole and practi-
tioners ’roles within it (22, 32, 37). In summary, an im-
portant part of initiating and maintaining collaborative
working is fostering both the knowing and relational as-
pects of collaborative working.
Practitioners —engagement
Interventions and the associated changes in practice do
not follow in a straightforward sense from a decision at
an organisational level to introduce them. The actions of
practitioners are pivotal, as it is through such actions
that interventions are made on a day-to-day basis. As
practitioners are not passive, their engagement in pro-
posed changes in practice is crucial. This engagement
can take place on a number of different levels, ranging
from the individual (e.g. facilitating practitioners to feel
proud of their work) to the team level (e.g. feeling sup-
ported and trusted by colleagues) and through to the
organisational level (enabling practitioners to pursue
personal and professional goals) (5). The relative im-
portance of addressing each of these levels is unclear,
but it may be that it is simply necessary to ensure that
all of these levels of engagement are recognised and ad-
dressed as judged appropriate in the local context. It isworth bearing in mind that the rationales that practitioners
employ in their decision-making are likely to be con-
strained or enabled by these local contexts, in particular
whether or not the work environment is experienced as
supportive and colleagues and supervisors are trusted (5).
The extent of concordance between practitioners ’and
perceptions at an organisational level of the need (or not)
for changes in practice is a key explanatory element of
how engagement can take place (6). The extent of this
concordance can be first flu shed out by acknowledging
the potential contribution of practitioners ’experiential
knowledge to the development of proposed service
changes and incorporating this knowledge as appropri-
ate (8). This enables practitioners to feel that they have
contributed substantively to the development of, and
have an ongoing part to play in the implementation of,
the proposed service changes. Second, as practitioners ’
motivations are both intrinsic (such as practising in a way
consistent with their personal values and which gives
them pride in a ‘job well done ’) and extrinsic (such as the
approval of colleagues or the financial rewards associated
with practising at a higher level of expertise), then practi-
tioners need to believe that there is concordance between
achieving these goals and their participation in pro-
posed service changes. Third, as day-to-day work is usually
structured in a way that reflects different practitioners ’
current roles, status, and degree of autonomy, proposed
service changes that challenge these traditional ways of
working can demonstrate a significant lack of concordance
between practitioners ’and an organisation ’sp e r c e p t i o n s
about roles and responsibilities (7). The extent to which it
is perceived that an intervention challenges conventional
practice can therefore impact negatively on practitioner
engagement.
Practitioners —understanding and skills
Two aspects of practitioners ’understanding and skills
were identified as impacting upon their willingness and
ability to develop positive relationships with service users.
The first relates to knowing about mental health and how
mental health problems manifest in people ’sb e h a v i o u r
(50). For example, the tension between custody and treat-
ment models can be brought into sharp relief by differ-
ences in opinion about how to practice held by health
care and criminal justice practitioners (19). The second
aspect relates to knowing how to develop supportive re-
lationships with people with mental health problems.
This is grounded in knowing about mental health but
also requires support to develop practitioners ’ability to
practise empathically day to day (36) and to continue to
do so through supervision th at supports practitioners
to learn from reflecting on their own practice (28). The
examination of assumptions that underpin practise can
inform practitioners ’relationship-building in a way thatPearson et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:134 Page 7 of 12
supports offenders ’transitions into the community. For
example, if practitioners assume that offenders ’families
can offer the same social and emotional support that
their own family could provide, then their potential for
supporting offenders to mobilise their own social cap-
ital is reduced (41).
Interactions between practitioners and offenders
Engagement is defined by its flexible nature. This can
manifest in a number of ways, all of which demonstrate
to the individual that their needs and views are taken
seriously. For example, recognition of an individual ’s
unique history and its relevance to their current situ-
ation can be demonstrated by accurately reflecting back
what has been said (67). Initial engagement may need to
strike a balance between recognising past experience
(which may be negative) and a potentially positive ex-
perience of services in the future (34). Keeping individ-
uals engaged will require ongoing, demonstrably credible
actions that achieve access to the range of services that
an individual requires to support their mental health
both in prison and on release (15, 35).
A genuine recognition of offenders ’individuality is the
lodestar that can guide practitioners ’interactions with
offenders in a way that promotes engagement and a net-
work of actions and relationships that promote mental
health. The core mechanism at play is the motivation that
individuals gain from being involved in a supportive work-
ing relationship that recognises the humanity, strengths,
and particular challenges they face. This mechanism is
particularly powerful where offenders experience prison as
disempowering and lacking in people that care, as the
power difference between offenders and practitioners is
reduced (75). The relationship begins at the outset of col-
laborative care formulation by focusing on how to balance
working towards an individual ’s goals with evidence-
informed treatments (10, 12, 62) and the negotiation of
access to services to provide that care (13, 48). Such an
approach works towards building on the individual ’s
strengths, although consideration also needs to be given
to the way that an offender ’s gender, ethnicity, or reli-
gion/spirituality is part of their identity. It is vital to
understand how these contextual aspects of identity
impacts on an individual ’sj o u r n e yt o w a r d si m p r o v e d
mental health (64, 65). Offering a choice to the individ-
ual as to when meetings take place can facilitate initial
engagement, and accurately reflecting back what an in-
dividual has discussed can demonstrate understanding
and empathy (67). The initial recognition and care for-
mulation is just the first step of the journey towards re-
settlement, rehabilitation, and mental health on which
practitioners can accompany offenders.
The metaphor of accompanying the individual on a
journey is useful. The path may be long but has areachable destination, and travelling along it with others
will help to get over the lows and reach the highs. Accom-
panying a person on this journey requires practitioners to
not confine therapeutic interactions to formal therapy ses-
sions (33) and to work flexibly by increasing or decreasing
their level of support as appropriate for the individual at
different stages (64). The support a practitioner should
provide is distinguished by not being judgmental or stig-
matising (27, 42) and functions by providing a coherent
‘bridge ’between an individual ’s current identity and the
future identity they want (27).
The principles of mentalisation-based therapy (MBT)
[29] can help structure interactions between practitioners
and offenders even when not using MBT as a formal
therapeutic approach. An offender ’s ability to understand
the relationship between their thoughts, emotions, and ac-
tions can be enabled by a practitioner ’s ability to under-
stand, recognise, and manage the impact of an offender ’s
mental state (in particular their level of arousal) on
their ability to interact. Attaining a non-judgemental
understanding of the links between one ’so w n( a n do t h e r ’s)
thoughts, emotions, and actions ( ‘mentalisation ’)i n v o l v e s
the practitioner enabling the offender to make use of
their own capacities for reflection and future planning (72,
74). Interactions characterised by a willingness to ex-
plore issues (rather than simply transfer expert know-
ledge) and support individuals to attend to their own
feelings (rather than identifying and naming these feel-
ings) should support the process of mentalisation (74).
Such interactions require a delicate balance to be struck
between intellectual analysis and emotional involvement,
as both of these capabilities are needed to reflect on the
links between thoughts, emotions, and actions and how a
person may wish to act differently in the future (72). The
creation of a safe and sensitive interpersonal environ-
ment is necessary for a person to have the confidence
to reflect and ‘mentalise ’whilst regulating his/her emo-
tional state (73).
Remaining responsive to an individual ’s circumstances
is a key aspect that permeates the supportive relationship.
This can manifest in a variety of ways, including main-
taining sensitivity to the appropriateness of individual
or group work (47); providing care that is sensitive to
the unique needs of individuals who have experienced
trauma (39); facilitating self-expression across a range
of psychological needs through, for example, art therapy
(45); and recognising offenders ’efforts to progress (63).
When, for whatever reason, the supportive relationship
falters, if the practitioner takes the time to address the rea-
sons for this happening, then the risk of discontinuity is
reduced (29).
However, the practitioner is not the sole actor in pro-
viding the breadth and depth of the supportive relation-
ship described above. Practitioners ’support can providePearson et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:134 Page 8 of 12
the foundation and stimulus for the individual to repair
or create their own supportive relationships with signifi-
cant others or peers (30), and/or practitioners can en-
courage and enable significant others and peers to
provide support for the individual that can endure long
beyond the end of the practitioner ’s supportive relation-
ship (30, 42, 64). In short, the practitioner has a key role
to play in cultivating facilitative contexts that allow the
supportive community mechanisms of relationships with
family and friends to operate.
Offenders —organisational context
For offenders, the prison environment can set the tone
for all of the interactions that take place within it and
therefore the extent to which offenders are motivated to
engage with services. A facilitative environment is char-
acterised by an organisational environment that offers
choice in, and access to, services (16). It is also evident
in the behaviour of prison staff and the interactions they
have with offenders —this can take the form of explain-
ing and consistently applying rules and demonstrating
tolerance in interactions with offenders (16). The devel-
opment of supportive relationships can be assisted when
teams of professionals are themselves diverse (for example,
in gender and culture), as this increases opportunities for
the development of client-pract itioner relationships where
the client has a particular connection with, or identifies
with, a practitioner ’s life experiences (57). Although there
are clearly restrictions within the prison environment in
terms of depriving individuals of their liberty, it can still set
a supportive tone for engagement by supporting the com-
mon human drive to find meaning in daily activities such
as work and exercise (49).
Offenders —perceptions, understanding, and skills
Two key sequential steps in an offender ’s progress to-
wards improved mental health are their constructive en-
gagement with services and the cultivation of skills that
enable self-care. Engagement requires trust in both indi-
vidual practitioners and the system in which these prac-
titioners work. Offenders need to have reason to believe
that, if they approach and engage with practitioners, they
will be treated empathically and fairly (4) and that by dis-
cussing mental health issues that may lead to treatment
they are not risking a negative impact on the length of
their sentence (3). Similarly, offenders need to have reason
to believe that communication between agencies is timely
and accurate so that care is provided in a co-ordinated
manner (4, 32). It is suggested that differences in the per-
ception of organisational boundaries between offenders
and practitioners, with offenders seeing ‘one service pro-
vided by different people ’and practitioners seeing ‘many
separate services with separate provision ’, are one reason
why offenders ’trust in practitioners and the system canfalter (32). If practitioners explore offenders ’concerns
(based on their prior experiences), then there is an oppor-
tunity to begin engagement even though imperfect service
provision is the reality (31).
Engagement provides the foundation for cultivating
the skills that will enable self-care. It is suggested that
developing ‘mindfulness ’skills, the ability to be aware of
one’s own mood state and its relationship with what is cur-
rently happening, can underpin the development of other
mental health self-care skills (46). In this way, and in con-
junction with the development of communication and social
skills, an upward self-supp orting spiral is initiated —self-
awareness can increase receptivity to learning new mental
health skills, which increase empathic skills and an offender ’s
ability to form or re-connect w ith a supportive social envir-
onment, which promotes effort st o w a r d sr e s e t t l e m e n ta n d
rehabilitation (26) and so on. Inspiration by and emulation
ofothers who have had similar experiences can increase
ability to self-manage and take p ersonal responsibility (71).
Summary of the conceptual platform
Our findings can be summarised in the form of a concep-
tual platform, specifying the core set of processes of how an
integrated, person-centred system to improve the mental
health of offenders with common mental health problems
is proposed to work. Such a system works through the
following:
/C15Different systems, in particular health and criminal
justice, having goals that are consistent with one
another
/C15Attaining consistency between strategic goals and
the goals of practitioners
/C15Making referral pathways and links between
organisations comprehensible to practitioners and
providing opportunity for the development of
constructive working relationships
/C15Practitioners being facilitated and enabled to balance
factors that can be in tension —for example, ‘knowing
how ’as well as ‘knowing that ’, analysing one ’so w n
behaviour whilst remaining attentive to emotions, and
working towards an individual ’s goals
/C15Practitioners being facilitated and enabled to apply
scientific and experiential knowledge judiciously in
working with individual offenders, colleagues, and
the systems in which services are delivered
/C15Practitioners having sufficient knowledge about
mental health and how to develop supportive
relationships with people with mental health issues
/C15Recognising the individuality of offenders throughout
all interactions in the criminal justice, health, and
social care systems
/C15Aligning resources so as to facilitate offenders to
achieve their collaboratively agreed goalsPearson et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:134 Page 9 of 12
/C15Practitioners supporting reconnection with, and/or
development of, networks of support outside of
prison
/C15Offenders having reasons to trust practitioners,
services, and systems
Discussion
Drawing on sources both within and beyond the fields of
criminal justice and offender health, we have developed
explanatory accounts of context-mechanism-outcome con-
figurations relating to offenders ’mental health (reported in
the‘Findings ’section). Our findings show how the ideal of
delivering an integrated, person-centred system to improve
collaborative mental health care for offenders inherently
operates through the constrained or enabled decision-
making of both practitioners and offenders and how
this takes place at the interstices of multiple cross-
cutting relationships and systems.
This paper ’s distinctive contribution is to bring to-
gether these explanatory accounts in concert so as to
further understand the ways in which sustainable change
can be attained within a complex system. Mapping the
theories that can underpin change within a complex sys-
tem makes the route towards achieving sustainable
change clearer, albeit not that much less daunting.
We are using these accounts to inform the development
of an intervention to improve collaborative mental health
care for offenders with common mental health problems.
In addition to the instrumental use of the knowledge
constructed in this review to contribute to intervention
development, there is an important conceptual use of
this knowledge [30] to prompt critical re-thinking about
the way that collaborative care is organised to improve
collaborative mental health care for offenders with com-
mon mental health problems. The conceptual platform
presented in this paper can also be used to stimulate a
wide range of stakeholders (service users, practitioners,
commissioners, and policy makers) to think differently
about how mental health care for offenders is designed
and delivered. It also has potential application outside of
offender health care in fields of practice where collabora-
tive and integrated working is required, particularly where
services are delivered across sectors and professional
groups, and where interventions need to complement and
not replace existing service and voluntary resources. The
integrated care of people with long-term conditions is one
area where the conceptual platform may have particular
resonance, although it is unlikely to be ‘transferable ’in its
entirety.
Our use of a realist review to identify and articulate in
detail the accounts that explain how a complex system
to improve mental health care of offenders could operate
is a novel application of the approach. We found that a
realist approach provided a common language and logicof inquiry that enabled us to confidently go beyond a
single field (offender health care) in our search for, and
articulation of, these accounts. Whilst precise identifica-
tion of contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes eluded us
at times, we found using the working definitions of these
concepts highly important for structuring our inquiry
and enabling us to discuss, debate, and develop the
accounts. The language of ‘contexts, mechanisms, and
outcomes ’, which we primarily expressed in the form of
‘If…then’statements, was also straightforward enough to
enable us to access both the lived experience of the peer
researcher group and the academic and practitioner
k n o w l e d g eo ft h ea d v i s o r yg r o u pi naf o r mt h a tw a s
consistent with the other explanatory accounts we were
identifying and articulating in the review.
Strengths and limitations
Whilst we made significant efforts to ensure transparency
in this study, we acknowledge that this is a difficult task in
a realist review and we do not claim to have been able to
document all of the many decisions that were made in the
course of conducting this review. The high number of
sources identified and obtained in this review, the variety
of presentation and reporting, and the often ‘hidden ’
nature of accounts within these sources mean that there is
a risk that we missed relevant theories, even though
we shared emerging findings with our advisory group
throughout the review. The selection of mentalisation-
based therapy as a key component was made prior to
the review, based on an appraisal of potential therapeutic
approaches for individuals with mixed mental health
problems; the magnitude of psychological literature pre-
cluded a full review of all potential approaches. Given that
we did not identify any significant ‘competing ’accounts,
there is also a risk that we were not fully aware of how
our own conceptualisation of issues impacted on our
reading of sources, although we endeavoured to exam-
ine and make plain our initial conceptualisations at the
outset. Finally, our conceptual platform does not in-
clude any accounts relating to the resource implications
of changes in service delivery.
Conclusion
We have demonstrated how a realist review can be applied
and adapted for the purposes of specifying the essential
components of how an integrated, person-centred system
to improve offenders ’mental health is proposed to work.
In providing this worked example, we have contributed
substantively both to understanding of how integrated,
person-centred systems are proposed to work and the de-
velopment of methods that can underpin theory-driven
intervention development [4 –6]. Our approach to synthe-
sis, which built on the understandings and insights of both
academic theory and the lived experience of bothPearson et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:134 Page 10 of 12
practitioners and offenders, complements approaches to
theory synthesis that focus solely on academic theory [31].
