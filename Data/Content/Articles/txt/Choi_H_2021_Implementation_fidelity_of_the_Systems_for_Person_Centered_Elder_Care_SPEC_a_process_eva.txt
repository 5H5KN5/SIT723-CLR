Implementation fidelity of the Systems for
Person-Centered Elder Care (SPEC): a
process evaluation study
Hyoungshim Choi1, Young-il Jung2and Hongsoo Kim3*
Abstract
Background: The Systems for Person-Centered Elder Care (SPEC), a complex intervention, was conducted to
examine its effectiveness as a technology-enhanced, multidisciplinary, and integrated care model for frail older
persons among ten nursing homes (NHs) in South Korea where formal long-term care has recently been
introduced. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation fidelity of the SPEC intervention and to
identify moderating factors that influence the implementation fidelity.
Methods: This study was a process evaluation based on an evidence-based framework for implementation fidelity
using a mixed-methods design. Quantitative data from consultant logbooks, NH documentations, an information
and communications technology (ICT) system, and a standardized questionnaire were collected from April 2015 to
December 2016 and analyzed by calculating the descriptive statistics. Semi-structured focus group interviews were
held with multidisciplinary teams from the participating NHs. Qualitative data from a semi-structured questionnaire
and the focus group interviews were analyzed using content analysis.
Results: The SPEC program demonstrated good implementation fidelity, and adherence to the SPEC program was
strong in all aspects, such as content, coverage, frequency, and duration. Of the participating on-site coordinators,
60% reported that the SPEC model positively impacted needs assessment and the reporting system for resident
care. The important facilitating factors were tailored facilitating strategies, assurance of the quality of delivery, and
recruitment strategies.
Conclusion: The effectiveness of the SPEC program was driven by good implementation fidelity. The key factors of
good implementation fidelity were tailored delivery of evidence-based interventions over process evaluation work,
facilitating strategies, and ICT support. Larger implementation studies with a more user-friendly ICT system are
recommended.

Background
The quality of care for older residents in nursing homes
(NHs) is closely related to their quality of life because
the care is provided where they live [ 1–3]. If older adults
residing in NHs do not receive quality services, they may
experience poor health and functionality, more emer-
gency room visits, unnecessary acute hospital admission,
and premature death; these outcomes add to the bur-
dens of older adults, families, and society as a whole [ 4,
5]. While innovative interventions to improve nursing
home quality are valuable and much needed, such inter-
ventions for vulnerable older residents are often complex
and difficult to implement [ 6].
Moreover, evaluating the effectiveness of innovative
public health interventions is also challenging. Problems
targeted by such interventions are associated with mul-
tiple causes targeting multiple levels, so the public health
interventions include multiple components that can
interact with one another, affecting both the respective
and overall outcomes [ 7,8]. Therefore, when evaluating
a complex intervention study, it is important to under-
stand the complex nature of interventions and to com-
bine the outcome evaluation and process evaluation [ 7].
Effectively combining them is accomplished by focusing
on the background elements that impact how an inter-
vention ’s goals are achieved, as these elements may also
be applied when implementing the same intervention in
other settings [ 7,9]. Careful evaluation of contextual fac-
tors related to the intervention process helps identify the
important functions of an intervention, even though
complex interventions may seem uncontrollable due to
various related phenomena [ 10–12].
Carroll et al. [ 13] proposed a conceptual framework
for implementation fidelity (CFIF), which focuses on
various aspects of adherence and moderating factors in-
fluencing intervention adherence. Several key compo-
nents of CFIF are unique and valuable for assessing
implementation fidelity: facilitation strategies such asintervention manuals, guidelines, training, and feedback
are used to optimize and standardize how an interven-
tion is conducted [ 13]. The quality of delivery is an as-
sessment of whether the intervention delivery process is
appropriate for achieving the original intentions of the
intervention [ 13]. Quality of delivery is a significant po-
tential moderating factor for the relationship between an
intervention and its implementation fidelity [ 13]. The re-
sponsiveness of participants relates both to the persons
who receive the intervention and to the persons who de-
liver the intervention [ 13]. The intervention complexity
is also an important component of implementation fidel-
ity, and it contributes to both the real nature of the
intervention and the description of the intervention [ 13].
The more complex the intervention, the harder it is to
obtain a higher level of implementation fidelity; however,
if an intervention is described in great detail, it may en-
hance implementation fidelity [ 13,14]. Additionally,
CFIF assumes that an intervention delivered by a person
with enthusiasm will have higher implementation fidelity
[13]. Hasson [ 10] presented a modified CFIF by adding
context and recruitment to Carroll et al. ’s model, de-
scribed above [ 13,15].Contex t refers to encompassing
social systems that include structures and cultures of or-
ganizations and historical and concurrent events [ 15].
When implementing a complex intervention,
organizational culture and the role of upper manage-
ment are very important [ 16]. Both the older residents
and the staff in NHs can experience optimal dignity,
well-being, and health through a safe and caring
organizational culture [ 17].Participant recruitment in-
cludes reasons for nonparticipation, the consistency of
recruitment procedures, and judgments by participants
regarding the outcomes and relevance of interventions
[18]. Hasson ’s modified CFIF suggested using a system-
atic evaluation of all moderating factors, as the interac-
tions between moderating factors are known to affect
the implementation of an intervention [ 15,18]. Hasson ’s
modified CFIF has been empirically examined as a useful
conceptual framework to systematically evaluate imple-
mentation fidelity and possible moderating factors af-
fecting implementation fidelity [ 15,19,20]. It is valuable
to measure and analyze implementation fidelity by pro-
viding guidance in organizing the data collection of ad-
herence and associated moderators in complex
interventions [ 15].
The Systems for Person-Centered Elder Care (SPEC)
is a technology-enhanced, multidisciplinary, integrated
care model for older adults with frailty [ 9]. The interven-
tion study hypothesized that the implementation of the
SPEC model will improve the quality of care in NHs
with limited healthcare provision, and the improvement
will promote the health/functional outcomes and quality
of life of old NH residents with multimorbidity [ 9]. ThisContributions to the literature
/C15This study has shown that pre-planned theory-based process
evaluation and a specified study protocol are important for
implementation fidelity in complex interventions.
/C15This study addresses tailored strategies to facilitate
implementation, such as consulting tailored to the needs
and context of each participating nursing home, that are
essential to increasing adherence in an intervention.
/C15We found that the cloud-based online ICT system improves
the quality of care by promoting communication between
care teams and the research team and generating useful in-
stitutional data to monitor and support resident care.Choi et al. Implementation Science           (2021) 16:52 Page 2 of 13
complex intervention was implemented in ten nursing
homes that had been certified and reimbursed by public
long-term care insurance (LTCI) in South Korea over 21
months between 2015 and 2016 (Fig. 1). As a complex
intervention model based on Wagner ’s Chronic Care
Model, the SPEC [ 9] consists of five components: com-
prehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) based on the Ko-
rean version of the interRAI long-term care facility [ 21],
individualized need-based care planning (CP), interdis-
ciplinary case conferences (ICCs), care coordination
(CC), and information and communications technology
(ICT) tools (Fig. 2).
Each participating NH had an on-site SPEC coordin-
ator team, typically composed of a nurse and a social
worker, who performed CGA, developed a care plan
from the assessment of each participating resident, ran
optional ICCs, and communicated with the SPEC con-
sultant. The SPEC consultant trained and empowered
the NH staff, particularly the on-site SPEC coordinator
team, to improve the care quality of the participating
NHs. The SPEC consultant facilitated and evaluated the
entire implementation process of the SPEC intervention
for each participating NH; offered training sessions, care
coordination, and on- and off-line consultation; and
monitored the progress of the intervention through a
cloud-based ICT system on a regular basis. The effect-
iveness of the intervention was evaluated through
stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trials, and the inter-
vention (the SPEC program) significantly improved qual-
ity of care as measured by a composite quality indicator
(QI; mean difference −0.025 [CI −0.037 to −0.014, p<
.0001]) [ 22].Kim et al. ’s[22] study focused on evaluating only the
effectiveness of the SPEC intervention; the process
evaluation described in this article was conducted in par-
allel with the effectiveness study. We designed this study
to evaluate implementation fidelity and to identify mod-
erating factors that could influence the implementation
fidelity of complex interventions. The conceptual frame-
work of the current study (Fig. 3) was developed by
combining Hasson ’s [15] modified CFIF with Grant
et al.’s[23] framework for designing process evaluations
for cluster-randomized trials of complex interventions
[15,21]. The latter includes domains (e.g., recruitment
of clusters, recruitment, and reach of individuals) that
can help to investigate the external validity of an effect-
iveness study for the SPEC intervention.
This study hypothesized that fidelity is influenced by
six moderating factors in the combined/modified CFIF:
participant responsiveness to SPEC interventions, the
complexity of interventions, facilitation strategies, the
quality of delivery, context, and participant recruitment
(Fig. 3). We measured the adherence of implementation
fidelity by rating the degree of executed and delivered
intervention components of the SPEC model based on
four subdomains (contents, frequency, duration, and
coverage) of the modified CFIF. We also analyzed the
moderating factors by using a deductive approach based
on the six moderating factors of the combined CFIF.
This study aims to evaluate the level of implementation
fidelity and explore the mechanism and moderating fac-
tors to optimize implementation fidelity for SPEC inter-
ventions for frail older adults in Korean nursing homes.
Fig. 1 Design of the SPEC study. The study was an incomplete stepped-wedge cluster randomized control trial (Kim et al. [ 22]). Each of the five
clusters contained two randomized nursing homes that implemented the SPEC program over the same period of time, from P2 to P7. The white
cells represent the control units, and the gray cells represent the units where the program was implemented. The measures to generate
incidence-based quality indicators were conducted at each arrow.Choi et al. Implementation Science           (2021) 16:52 Page 3 of 13
Methods
Study design
The present study used a mixed-methods design to in-
vestigate the implementation fidelity of the Systems for
Person-Centered Elder Care (SPEC) study [ 9]. The SPEC
intervention study utilized a prospective, incomplete,
stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial to examine the
effectiveness of the SPEC model among ten NHs in
South Korea. The SPEC intervention was implementedwith older adult residents in each participating NH for 6
months after a 3-month control period. The intervention
was rolled out to each NH over five different intervals in
sequence [ 22] (Fig. 2).
Study setting and participants
The intervention study was conducted at 10 NHs that
agreed to participate, all located in Seoul and the major
provinces in South Korea. In Korea, universal public

LTCI for older adults with a certain level of dependency
was newly introduced in 2008 in response to the chan-
ging family and social context and norms [ 24]. All the
participating NHs had residents registered in and reim-
bursed by the public LTCI and met certain regulations
for staffing, physical facilities, operations, and accredit-
ation [ 25]. We recruited NHs with 30 or more residents
and that met the staffing requirements of the LTCI: at
least one registered nurse or nursing assistant per 25
residents, one personal care assistant per 5 people, and
one social worker [ 26]. Older residents who received
intervention were those aged 65 or older who had stayed
in the participating NHs for at least 1 week, were neither
in a terminal condition nor comatose, and were capable
of study participation [ 22].
Data collection
The overall process evaluation plans for the SPEC trial
[9,21] were based on the conceptual framework of this
study addressed earlier (Fig. 3), guided by Hasson ’s [15]
modified CFIF and Grant et al. ’s[23] framework model
for designing process evaluation for cluster-randomizedcontrolled trials [ 9,15,22,23]. In each cluster, the
process data were gathered right before, during, and
after the 6-month intervention phase. Quantitative data
measured were entries from the SPEC consultants ’log-
books, the SPEC ICT system, and standardized question-
naire items. Qualitative data were collected from the
SPEC consultants ’logbooks, a semi-structured question-
naire for free-text responses, and focus group interviews.
The questionnaires were 12-item self-reported paper
questionnaires with two parts. One was a seven-item
standardized questionnaire with a 5-point Likert scale,
and the other was a five-item semi-structured question-
naire for free-text responses. The research team sent the
questionnaire by e-mail to on-site SPEC coordinators
and collected the completed questionnaires sealed in an
envelope during the visit for the focus group interview.
The standardized questionnaire and the results are re-
ported in Table 3. Additionally, relevant data for process
evaluation were obtained from the SPEC ICT system.
The focus group interviews with each NH ’s interdis-
ciplinary team were conducted by the first author,
assisted by a research assistant for process evaluation

after 6-month intervention periods for each NH for 1 h.
Each interdisciplinary team consisted of four to eight
professionals, including a NH head, practice nurse(s), so-
cial worker(s), physical therapist, occupational therapist,
and nutritionist, as well as on-site SPEC coordinators.
The focus group interviews were audio-taped and tran-
scribed by two research assistants. The researchers car-
rying out the focus group interviews completed a post-
interview reflection after each interview, which identified
any issues regarding delivery. The data were used to
evaluate adherence and potential moderators that af-
fected the implementation fidelity of the SPEC model.
Data analysis
Quantitative data from the standardized questionnaire
and data from the SPEC ICT systems were analyzed with
SAS 9.4 to measure descriptive statistics (frequency,
means, and percentages). All qualitative data, including
free-text responses from semi-structured questionnaires
and focus group interviews, were analyzed using content
analysis. The focus group interviews were audio-taped,
transcribed, and coded. The coding framework, includ-
ing domains of adherence and moderating factors guided
by modified/combined CFIF (Table 1, Fig. 3)[13,15,22], was generated. The first author of this study carried
out the coding of all qualitative data, and units of mean-
ing within the text were allocated to each code. The cor-
responding author cross-checked the coding for inter-
subjectivity. They then discussed until a consensus was
reached. Themes regarding potential moderating factors
that affected implementation fidelity were derived from
the interviewees based on the theoretical framework
from Hasson [ 15] and Grant et al. [23].

Content
All intervention components were delivered to ten NHs
as planned [ 9]. The SPEC consultant provided education
and consultations regarding CGAs, individualized need-
based CP, and optional ICCs, CC, and ICT tools for each
on-site SPEC coordinator. With the support of the SPEC
consultant, the actual SPEC intervention components
were executed and delivered to participating residents by
the care team led by an on-site SPEC coordinator team
for each participating NH (Table 2). Using the ICT tool,
the prototype SPEC ICT system, the research team pro-
vided tailored reports for NHs, families, and physicians

who contracted with each participating NH. The re-
search team operated the help desk to provide immedi-
ate support regarding the SPEC program.
Frequency/duration (dosage/dose delivery)
All intervention components were provided for partici-
pating NHs with the originally planned frequency and
duration. CGA, CP, and CC were delivered by the on-
site SPEC coordinator teams (RN-SW pair) at each par-
ticipating NH at least one time for each participating
resident; CP was implemented for participating residents
for about 6 months. ICC for complex cases was imple-
mented at least once a month by the care team led by
the SPEC coordinator team at each participating NH
with or without the SPEC consultant. Additionally, the
on-site coordinator team communicated with the SPEC
consultant and the help desk staff whenever necessary
through KaKao Talk, a free instant message and phone
call service (an ICT tool, Table 2). The results of a sur-
vey conducted with on-site SPEC coordinators revealed
that they had easy access to the internet at work and
accessed the SPEC ICT system at least 1 or 2 days per
week (Table 3).
Coverage (reach)
Participants also included 482 residents who received
the SPEC intervention [ 22]. CP and CC were provided
to 86.9% of the residents, while other intervention com-
ponents were delivered to all participating NHs and resi-
dents as planned (Table 2). The SPEC consultant
delivered the CGA and CP training to the on-site SPEC
coordinator teams, and the NH staff members (including
the coordinator team) performed the CGA and CP for
participating residents. In every participating NH, a
multidisciplinary care team performed at least six
ICCs—one ICC per month for the 6-month intervention
periods. The SPEC consultant and the on-site SPEC co-
ordinator teams cooperated to conduct the first and sec-
ond ICCs. A SPEC consultant led the first ICC to
demonstrate the process to an on-site SPEC coordinator
team in each home, and they conducted the second ICC
with the help of the SPEC consultant. The remaining
four ICCs were left to the on-site SPEC coordinator
team at each home.
Moderating factors
Participant responsiveness
There were positive responses from the participants re-
garding the SPEC model. About 75% of on-site SPEC co-
ordinators answered that they would recommend the
SPEC model to other NHs. However, only 15% were
willing to increase the usage of the SPEC ICT system in
their NH (Table 3). Positive responses from participants
regarding the general SPEC model included boostingCGAs, facilitating communication, and providing tai-
lored care plans. The participating on-site SPEC coordi-
nators expressed that CGA was very helpful for
assessing the needs of participating residents. They also
addressed how the SPEC model (intervention) facilitated
communication among multidisciplinary teams. Individu-
alized needs-based CP was reinforced by patient-centered
care. Most negative responses from participants focused
on SPEC ICT system use regarding user-friendliness and
additionally included duplication in documentation with
the existing system and lack of staffing levels and time.
The on-site SPEC coordinators complained that they had
to use an existing system along with the SPEC system,
leading them to consider the use of the SPEC ICT system
to be duplicated work. Moreover, they felt overwhelmed
because they had to carry out their duties within their
regular work hours with extra time and staffing necessi-
tated to accomplish all of the tasks related to the SPEC
intervention (Table 4).Table 3 Usage and user opinion for SPEC model and ICT

implementing SPEC model
Domain Themes Representative quotation from interviews
Participant
responsivenessBoosting CGA “The CGA tool was very useful to see the images of the old adults at a glance
and grasp the needs comprehensively. ”
Facilitating communication “Communication between care teams was enhanced with the SPEC ICT system. ”
“At the case conference, care teams gathered and communicated about the
patient, making it easier to understand the patient and get help from other
teams to implement interventions for patients. ”
Providing tailored care plan “The care plans are based on the list of problems derived from the needs
assessment and therefore, enable us to promote individual approach and to
provide tailored care plan for each patient. ”
Duplication of using SPEC system “I consider it a duplication using both the SPEC ICT system and the system
currently in use. ”
Lack of staffing level and time “I know the SPEC model is good, but we don ’t have human resources and time
to use it. There is no time to feed the result of needs assessments and care
plans into the SPEC model during working hours. If I want to use the SPEC
model, I may have to work overtime. ”
Intervention
complexityComprehensiveness of intervention description “The detailed manuals and materials for interventions were helpful, so I can
handle the tasks even though the interventions were complex.
Complexity of interventions “The SPEC model has so many steps. If we make an individual care plan, we
should complete CGA, prioritize the problem lists and choose interventions for
each problem from intervention checklists and get consent for the care plan
from patients or their family. ”,“Needs assessment items are too long and hard
to understand. ”
Difficulty of using ICT system “The method of inputting into the SPEC ICT system is too complicated because
most of the staff using the ICT system are not familiar with the computer. ”
Facilitating
strategiesProvision of immediate feedback “The SPEC consultant and help desk provide immediate answers for any
question asked through phone call and KakaoTalk, and it is very helpful. ”
Tailored consulting and extra education “I had no clue when I had to organize a case conference for the first time, but
it was very helpful of the SPEC consultant to participate in the case meeting,
giving us feedback and providing us with advice on planning the intervention. ”
Quality of
deliveryWell-prepared training and manuals “The training was well prepared overall, and after the theoretical training, it was
good to have a practical training with the care team to evaluate the needs of
real patients in the NH and set up care plans for the residents. ”
Provision of individual/institutional report “The most valuable advantage is that the individual problem list is automatically
derived from the needs assessment of each patient by algorithm, which is not
included in any existing evaluation system. ”“It was good to me that I can check
the execution rate of intervention immediately through the SPEC ICT system. ”
“An institutional report on the list of problems and the number of drug use for
a NH are very helpful. ”
Reflection of preferences of participants “When I set up a patient ’care plan, I need to get consent about the care plan
and therefore, ask the patient what he/she wants. ”“In particular, if the patient is
selected as a candidate for a case conference, we try to identify what
interventions are particularly preferred by the patient and reflect them in the
patient ’s care plan. ”
Needs for practical system for Korean NHs “It seems that some items in the CGA tool for the old adults do not fit with
Korean NHs. ”“When I am trying to make a care plan for an old adult, I don ’t
have enough contents to choose from in the care plan checklists of the SPEC
ICT system. It would be better to have a more realistic and practical list of care
plans for Korean NHs. ”
Recruitment Recruiting a proactive NH head “We expect the SPEC model to be used systematically to evaluate needs and
establish care plans. ”“Even if it ’s difficult, I think we should use the SPEC model
to improve the quality of care of NHs. ”
Presentation for key care team for participation “I cannot decide whether or not to use the SPEC model solely by myself even
though I am a NH head, so I would ask the research team to visit my NH and
explain it to the care team. ”“My staff worried about new tasks adding burden
on the participant, uncertainty about the effectiveness of interventions, and the
potential to receive complaints from patients and their families due to
participation in the study. ”
Difficulty of maintaining participation due to “I don ’t have enough time to use the SPEC ICT system. Some employees sayChoi et al. Implementation Science           (2021) 16:52 Page 8 of 13
Intervention complexity
The SPEC model is an integrated system with five inter-
active components. Each intervention component has
unique steps and tasks. For example, an individual care
plan needs a CGA for a single resident and a consent
from the resident or family for the care plan. Sixty-five
percent of on-site SPEC coordinators reported that the
interventions were helpful for their care planning. How-
ever, only half of the on-site coordinators answered that
their time needed for care planning was reduced and
that the SPEC model made their care planning for NH
residents easier (Table 3). Some on-site SPEC coordina-
tors were satisfied with clear descriptions of interven-
tions and their detailed manuals and materials. However,
other on-site coordinators complained about the com-
plexity of the ICT-based interventions. Some also found
the detailed assessment items of the CGA tool difficult
to fully comprehend. Additionally, the structured CP
procedure through the ICT system was also considered
to be somewhat challenging, as they were used to the
paper-based, open-text style CP. Another major com-
plaint reported was that the proto-type SPEC ICT sys-
tem was not user-friendly. Completion of the
computerized CGA and CP forms was challenging for
most of the on-site coordinators, who were not familiar
with electronic health recording systems (Table 4).
Strategies to facilitate implementation
General and tailored strategies were applied to facilitate
implementation. General strategies included information
sessions for top-level administers of participating NHs, a
kick-off meeting for interventions for each participating
NH, incentives for each NH, regular monitoring of the
extent of intervention implementation through the ICT
system, and provision of immediate feedback from the
SPEC consultant regarding any questions about theSPEC model. Tailored strategies included motivational
counseling with on-site SPEC coordinators, provision of
extra education sessions, and consulting tailored to the
needs and context of each NH. The SPEC consultant
was responsible for facilitating and monitoring the im-
plementation process. As a trained research nurse, the
SPEC consultant neither visited the participating nursing
homes daily nor conducted the intervention. The SPEC
consultant was a type of circulating resource nurse
coaching for implementation by the care staff team at
the participating homes under the lead of the on-site
SPEC coordinators; the main roles of the consultant
were educating the on-site SPEC coordinators to con-
duct the CGA and make care plans, demonstrating how
to use the computerized SPEC ICT system, coaching the
care team to conduct case conferences, and monitoring
the progress of the implementation process [ 9,22]. Most
on-site SPEC coordinators reported that the immediate
responses of the SPEC consultant and the help desk
when coordinators had SPEC model-related questions
were very helpful, promoting the use of the SPEC ICT
system and their maintained participation in this study.
Furthermore, an on-site SPEC coordinator said that the
extra education and counseling regarding case confer-
ences enabled them to organize their own case confer-
ences without needing the SPEC consultant (Table 4).
Quality of delivery
Approximately 65% of on-site SPEC coordinators an-
swered that the SPEC model was helpful to change their
needs assessment and reporting system; only 5% replied
that the model did not help them with their care plan-
ning and evaluation for NH residents (Table 3). Most
on-site SPEC coordinators rated the SPEC interventions
as excellent. For example, the provision of individual/in-
stitutional reports —such as CGA-based need/riskTable 4 Themes of moderating factors and selected interview quotations on experiences and perceptions of respondents in

workload that they would quit their job if I keep asking them to use the SPEC ICT
system. ”
Context Supportive or individualistic organizational culture “Multidisciplinary care team work together when we evaluate patient ’s needs
and set up care plans, making it easy to use the SPEC ICT system. For example,
nurses, social workers, and physical therapists each take care of certain items
given in the assessment tool. ”“The nursing team does not want to get involved
in using SPEC ICT system at all and does not cooperate, either. ”
Supportive leadership “The staff seems to be working hard in using the SPEC ICT system because at
the weekly meetings held each Monday, the NH head emphasizes the need for
the SPEC model and the quality improvement, and also checks the execution
rate of the intervention checklist. ”
Current events (Evaluation of National Health
Insurance Services, resignation of key person etc.)“I hope to delay the use of SPEC ICT system to after the institutional evaluation
of the National Health Insurance Services. ”“It is difficult to make an
individualized care plan for each patient when the staff, who is in charge of
setting up care plans with the SPEC model, quits the NH. ”Choi et al. Implementation Science           (2021) 16:52 Page 9 of 13
profiling and individualized needs-based CP using stan-
dardized care protocols and checklists —promoted com-
munication among contracted physicians, participating
residents, and their families and enhanced implementa-
tion fidelity. They also reported that they were satisfied
with the well-prepared training sessions and manuals, par-
ticularly the practical training with real cases from the NH
directly following CGA or CP education sessions. They
admitted that the process of agreement with individuals/
families regarding goal setting and care planning facili-
tated reflection about the preferences or choices of partici-
pants. However, they also suggested that more user-
friendly, practical ICT systems and protocols could be de-
veloped for use in Korean NHs (Table 4).
Recruitment
All of the residents who agreed and were eligible for this
study in each NH received the SPEC intervention, and
they were representative (Table 2). The research team
recruited proactive NH heads who were interested in
improving the quality of care. We gave presentations not
only to NH heads but also to key care team members
who could affect the decision of the NH heads regarding
study participation. The barriers to participating and
maintaining involvement were as follows: new tasks add-
ing burden on the participants, uncertainty about the ef-
fectiveness of interventions, and the potential to receive
complaints from patients and their families due to study
participation (Table 4).
Context
Organizational culture was among the most important
factors affecting implementation fidelity. The on-site
SPEC coordinators who belong to NHs with a support-
ive and open organizational culture expressed that co-
operation with other multidisciplinary teams encouraged
them to overcome the difficulty of using the new system.
On the other hand, an on-site SPEC coordinator who
worked as a social worker for an NH with an individual-
istic and closed organizational culture reported that he
had difficulties in implementing the SPEC model be-
cause some nurses of the nursing team were reluctant to
use the SPEC ICT system. Supportive and proactive atti-
tudes of the NH heads were also essential for successful
intervention implementation. The shortage of long-term
care workers in Korea has continued until recently; the
shortage of nursing personnel is serious, and a high
turnover rate is seen [ 25]. This is a factor that hinders
the formation of a supportive, collaborative, and open
organizational culture [ 25]. Additionally, unexpected
events that required additional staffing and time nega-
tively impacted aspects of the intervention implementa-
tion, such as initiating the accreditation process
mandated by the public LTCI insurer. Publicinstitutional evaluation for accreditation is mandatory
every 2 to 3 years, and evaluation results are disclosed to
the public, thus affecting users ’choices [ 26]. Implemen-
tation was also impacted in some cases by the resigna-
tion of a SPEC coordinator, a key person in intervention
implementation (Table 4).
Discussion
This process evaluation study aimed to investigate how
the SPEC intervention, an ICT-enhanced, multidisciplin-
ary, integrated care management model [ 9], was effective
(positive outcomes) through examining the interven-
tion’s implementation process. We found that the five
components of the SPEC model were designed well for
the purpose (quality improvement) according to the in-
terviews with key participants (Table 4). We also exam-
ined how well the components were implemented as
planned (Table 2). The strong adherence of participating
homes —the implementation fidelity —was attributed to
the moderating factors hypothesized in our conceptual
model for this study. The importance of approaching
implementation issues from a theoretical perspective
and assessing fidelity within the process evaluation of a
health program has been emphasized [ 19]. We were able
to systematically evaluate adherence and moderating fac-
tors of implementation fidelity alongside the modified/
combined CFIF. It was valuable to assess and analyze the
roles of the six domains of the modified/combined CFIF.
This is in line with previous studies emphasizing that
the six moderating factors in the framework influenced
fidelity in a complex and interrelated manner [ 18–20].
Tailored facilitating strategies, assurance of the quality
of delivery, and recruitment strategies were facilitators.
While intervention complexity was a barrier to adher-
ence, the context and participant response both posi-
tively and negatively influenced implementation fidelity.
The main results of the SPEC study and the interviews
with interdisciplinary team members (Table 4) sup-
ported the effectiveness of the five key components of
the SPEC model. The health statuses of participating
older residents were relatively severe and complicated;
thus, those participants needed comprehensive and pro-
active interventions [ 27]. Therefore, the SPEC interven-
tion required extra time and effort.
There were several facilitating factors for the success-
ful implementation of the SPEC model. First is tailored
delivery of evidence-based comprehensive interventions
over process evaluation work guided by the theoretical
framework . Pre-specifying and publishing study proto-
cols improves the compliance of randomized trials of
complex interventions by comparing intended interven-
tions with implemented interventions [ 23,28]. Previous
studies suggested that consolidated framework and
multi-faceted facilitating strategies are important forChoi et al. Implementation Science           (2021) 16:52 Page 10 of 13
successfully implementing complex interventions [ 29,
30]. The SPEC research team developed theory-based
process evaluations and followed the process evaluation
protocols as much as possible (Table 2). According to a
previous process evaluation study for dementia-specific
case conferences in NHs, an optimizing process struc-
ture is very important for increasing the effectiveness of
randomized controlled trials [ 31].
The second facilitating factor is the role of the SPEC
consultant and facilitating strategies . The SPEC research
team attempted to recruit proactive NH heads. We held
presentations for key care teams because the expecta-
tions of the health care team for changes in the care
process or improvement in the quality of care promote
the performance of interventions [ 29,30]. The SPEC co-
ordinator provided well-prepared training and manuals
to NH coordinators. In addition, the SPEC consultant
monitored implementation fidelity through the SPEC
ICT system regularly and gave immediate feedback to
increase implementation fidelity. This finding correlates
with previous studies suggesting that some actions of a
facilitator, such as catalytic action in multidisciplinary
teams and encouraging advice, influenced the effective-
ness of the intervention positively [ 10]. Most on-site
SPEC coordinators agreed that the tailored consulting
was very helpful. A prior study ’s finding that the support
of a facilitator was the most attractive aspect of the
nurse-led cognitive program regarding falls in older
adults with frailty was consistent with the results of the
current study [ 32].
The third facilitating factor is the cloud-based online
ICT system , which supports resident care and generates
institutional data. The ICT system was a prototype, com-
puterized version of a CGA-based care management tool.
Given the low staffing, the ICT system made it easier for
the on-site coordinating team to implement the SPEC in-
terventions (Table 3). The ICT system promoted commu-
nication between the care teams and the research team
because they had access anytime and anywhere to on-site
SPEC coordinators, who commented that the ICT system
facilitated communication among multidisciplinary teams.
The system improved the ease of storing and tracking
resident data, generated useful tailored reports on the
NHs, and provided resources for care providers/managers.
Our findings were consistent with a previous study ’sr e -
sults indicating that e-consultation promotes data-driven
improvements [ 33]. In this study, our research team was
able to monitor the implementation fidelity in real time
through the ICT system and manage the timeline for
planned interventions for each participating NH. These
findings resonate with a systematic review paper that e-
consultation facilitates timely specialty advice [ 34].
In addition, several lessons to expand the SPEC model
were learned. Firstly, sufficient institutional support isnecessary to implement a new technology-enhanced in-
tegrated care model such as SPEC. Our results also high-
light that high workloads and time pressure were the
most widely represented barriers in applying new inter-
ventions in NHs [ 31]. According to the on-site SPEC co-
ordinators, the SPEC model was useful for planning care
and for improving the quality of care; however, partici-
pating NHs did not want to increase their usage of the
SPEC model due to their heavy workloads and insuffi-
cient compensation (Tables 3and 4). Therefore, suffi-
cient workforce staffing and compensation through
institutional and public LTCI policies for supporting in-
stitutions should be implemented to accommodate the
adoption of a new system. Secondly, tailored and con-
tinuing education and training for NH staff are necessary
for applying an ICT system in NHs. Via the user opinion
questionnaire and interviews of key respondents, the
participating staff members pointed out that they had
difficulty using the SPEC ICT system and that the SPEC
ICT system did not reduce the time required for effect-
ive care planning (Tables 3and4). According to a previ-
ous study with NH residents [ 35], heavy pressure to
complete the interRAI-LTCF evaluation and insufficient
computer equipment to perform it were hindrance fac-
tors [ 21]. Third, the addition of more specific and prac-
tical contents for participating NHs residents ’care is
essential to promoting the performance of the interven-
tions. In this study, some of the on-site SPEC coordina-
tors asked for more practical and realistic care planning
lists that apply to their residents (Table 4).
The SPEC study is considered to have been effective in
achieving some expected results by conducting planned
interventions, but it also has several limitations. First,
the intervention and follow-up periods were short. The
intensive intervention with the support of the research
team for 3 months and the follow-up interval after the
staff did not have the support of the research team for
another 3 months was the minimum requirements for
performance evaluation. If the intervention were to take
place for a longer period, more NH residents would be
able to participate in the optional ICC, and various ef-
fects might be observed. Second, although qualitative
and quantitative assessments were used to understand
the moderating factors for implementation fidelity, there
may be missing subjects or areas. Moreover, we did not
conduct a process evaluation of the responsiveness of
residents and family members. Residents were likely to
be unable to participate as they often had poor cognitive
function, insufficient understanding of interventions, and
difficulty with communication. The family members did
not visit often and were not interested in being con-
tacted for investigation. For this reason, this study
mainly relied on the opinions of the service providers
and did not investigate the resident experience andChoi et al. Implementation Science           (2021) 16:52 Page 11 of 13
family/caregiver satisfaction. Third, the results of this
study may not be objective because process evaluation
was done by the SPEC research team. Fourth, there are
limited studies of process evaluation on ICT-based qual-
ity improvement interventions that have been applied to
clinical trials, making it difficult to compare this study
with previous studies.
Conclusions
The process evaluation study of moderating factors that
affect the implementation fidelity of SPEC indicates that
the effectiveness of the SPEC model may depend on
whether or not the evidence-based interventions are
strictly implemented. This study helps address the im-
portance of process evaluation in promoting the imple-
mentation fidelity of interventions. It also provides
evidence for developing theory-based process evaluations
for adopting and diffusing a technology-enhanced care
model for NH residents.
Therefore, this study offers several suggestions for fu-
ture research. The development and application of re-
search tools are required to reflect the responsiveness of
participating residents with limited functional status and
their family members, which will be helpful for compre-
hensive process evaluation. We also suggest a repeated
study of SPEC on a large scale, under different settings,
and in other countries. In addition, developing a more
user-friendly ICT system can facilitate large-scale imple-
mentations of the SPEC program.
