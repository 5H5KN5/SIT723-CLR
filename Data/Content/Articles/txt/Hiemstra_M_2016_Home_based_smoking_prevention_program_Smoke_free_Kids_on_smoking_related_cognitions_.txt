Objectives: The home-based smoking prevention programme ‘Smoke-free
Kids’did not have an effect on primary outcome smoking initiation. A
possible explanation may be that the programme has a delayed effect. The
aim of this study was to evaluate the effects on the development of importantprecursors of smoking: smoking-related cognitions.Methods: We used a cluster randomised controlled trial in 9- to 11-year-old
children and their mothers. The intervention condition received ﬁve activity
modules, including a communication sheet for mothers, by mail at four-weekintervals. The control condition received a fact-based programme. Secondaryoutcomes were attitudes, self-ef ﬁcacy and social norms. Latent growth curves
analyses were used to calculate the development of cognitions over time.
Subsequently, path modelling was used to estimate the programme effects onthe initial level and growth of each cognition.
Results: Analyses were performed on 1398 never-smoking children at base-
line. Results showed that for children in the intervention condition, perceivedmaternal norms increased less strongly as compared to the control condition(β=−.10,p= .03). No effects were found for the other cognitions.
Conclusion: Based on the limited effects, we do not assume that the
programme will have a delayed effect on smoking behaviour later duringadolescence.

Introduction
Smoking during adolescence is a worldwide public health problem (World Health
Organization, 2012 ). By the age 10, 4% of Dutch children have already tried smoking.
This increases to 6% of 11-year-olds, 11% of 12-year-olds and 35% of 14-year-olds(Stivoro,
2012 ). Children who try smoking at a young age are more likely to develop

long-enduring smoking patterns (e.g. Chassin, Presson, Pitts, & Sherman, 2000 ).
Tobacco prevention programmes aim to delay the age of smoking onset and decreasethe prevalence of early initiators. It is important to intervene before children form atti-tudes and beliefs about smoking and before they have to deal with smoking-related sit-
uations with peers. Therefore, smoking prevention in elementary school-aged children
is paramount as most children are still never-smokers at this stage. In the United States,a smoking prevention programme called ‘Smoke-free Kids ’for children of smoking par-
ents has shown to be effective with positive effects on smoking initiation after36 months. Only 12% of children had tried smoking in the intervention condition vs.19% in the control condition (OR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.39 –3.37, p< .001) (Jackson &
Dickinson,
2003 ,2006 ). In a previous paper, we tested the long-term effects of an
adapted Dutch Smoke-free Kids programme on children of smoking and non-smoking
parents (Hiemstra et al., 2014 ). After 36 months, we found that 10.8% of children in
the intervention condition tried smoking compared to 12% in the intervention condition,which was not signi ﬁcant (OR = .90, 95% CI = .63 –1.27, p= .54). These ﬁndings are
in line with a later US trial for children of non-smoking parents in which also nosigniﬁcant effects were found (Jackson & Dickinson,
2011 ). Our ﬁndings are also
comparable with other elementary school prevention programs, that in general show nosigniﬁcant effects (Crone, Spruijt, Dijkstra, Willemsen, & Paulussen,
2011 ; Marsiglia,
Kulis, Yabiku, Nieri, & Coleman, 2011 ; Wang et al., 2011 ) or negative effects (Elek,
Wagstaff, & Hecht, 2010 ) on smoking onset. A possible explanation for the absence of
an effect may be that smoking prevention in elementary-aged children is too early, andtoo far from the actual age of onset to be related. A related explanation may be that theprogramme has a delayed effect (cf. Crone et al.,
2011). At 36 months, there was a
1.2% difference between the two conditions: a difference that might become lar-ger later in adolescence. To gain more insight into this potential explanation, we exam-ined whether the intervention programme had an effect on relevant precursors ofsmoking.
The process that ultimately leads to smoking behaviour starts years before actual
smoking occurs with the development of smoking-related cognitions (Leventhal &Cleary,
1980 ). Conform the Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1991 ) important
cognitions are attitudes, self-ef ﬁcacy and social norms. Previous research has shown
that smoking-related cognitions indeed do predict smoking later in life (Engels &Willemsen,
2004 ; Harakeh & Vollebergh, 2011; Huver, Engels, & de Vries, 2006 ;
Huver, Engels, Vermulst, & de Vries, 2007 ; Otten, Harakeh, Vermulst, van den
Eijnden, & Engels, 2007 ; Veselska, Madarasova Geckova, Reijneveld, & van Dijk,
2011 ).
On the short term, we have tested the effects on these cognitions and found that
the Smoke-free Kids programme has effects on the social norms of friends, bestfriend, mother (marginally), and self-ef ﬁcacy (contrary to expectations) (Hiemstra,
Ringlever, Otten, van Schayck, & Engels,
2013 ). This study examined the effects of
the intervention programme on the development of these smoking-related cognitionsfrom baseline to 36-month follow-up. We expect that when the programme has aneffect on the development of important precursors of smoking behaviour, this may be
an indication of a delayed effect on the smoking behaviour of adolescents later in
life.132 M. Hiemstra et al.
Methods
Procedure
Families were recruited via primary schools in the Netherlands (i.e. active informed
consent). In 2008, a letter was sent to 1347 school boards requesting that they distributea letter to all children aged 9 –11 to recruit participants. After telephonic contact with
the schools, 630 (47%) were willing to participate. Participation by the families wasgiven by returning the recruitment letter or registering online via a secured web page.
Participants had to ﬁt the following inclusion criteria: children had to be between
9- and 11-year-olds; participating adults had to be mothers or female guardians; bothmother and child needed to be able to read and speak Dutch; and only one child perhousehold was eligible to participate. A total of 1490 mothers and children wereselected.
Data were collected by means of telephone interviews (60.2%) or by written
questionnaires (39.8%). Trained Master students administered the telephone interviewswith mothers and children. At baseline, mothers were interviewed ﬁrst to check the
eligibility of the family. Children were interviewed several days later. At follow-up,
only the children were interviewed. Prior to the interview, we made sure that mothersand the children could speak freely in order to assure privacy. To protect children fromparents listening to their child responding to questions from the interviewer, we onlyused closed-ended questions. Questionnaires were sent via mail and returned in twoseparate enclosed envelopes, allowing children to return their own questionnaire withouttheir mother reading their answers.
The baseline assessment of mothers and children took place between December
2008 and June 2009. From February 2008 to September 2009, the intervention was
mailed at four-week intervals to participants of both conditions, consisting of ﬁve activ-
ity modules or fact sheets. The follow-up measures were 6, 12, 24 and 36 months afterbaseline and only assessed the children by telephone or mail. The 36-month assessmentwas conducted between December 2011 and June 2012. Each family received €10 for
completing all measurements (i.e. baseline to 36 months). In addition, ﬁve travellers ’
checks of €1000 were raf ﬂed among these families. The ethics committee of the Faculty
of Social Sciences at the Radboud University Nijmegen approved the trial protocol
registered in the Dutch Trial Register (NTR1465).
Participants
A total of 1490 mothers and children were selected to participate in the study. From
12 families, we received only a baseline measurement of the mother. Therefore, thesefamilies were excluded. Overall, 418 schools were randomised in the interventioncondition ( n= 728 children) and in the control condition ( n= 750 children). Children
who had already puffed a cigarette at baseline ( n= 80, 5.4%) were included in the
programme, due to con ﬁdentiality, but excluded from the analyses, leaving 1398
never-smoking children eligible for the analyses. Overall, the participation rate was1328 children (95%) at 6 months, 1284 children (91.8%) at 12 months, 1255 children(89.8%) at 24 months and 1238 children (88.6%) at 36 months (Figure
1). Attrition
analysis comparing children that participated in wave ﬁve and those that dropped outPsychology & Health 133
showed that children of the intervention condition were more likely to drop out than
children in the control condition (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.78 –3.84, p< .001). Children
from one current and one former smoking parent were more likely to drop out thanchildren from non-smoking parents (OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.07 –3.57, p= .03).
Reasons for dropout included loss of interest in participating or the inability of
investigators to get in touch with the children (either by phone or by paper-basedquestionnaires).

Theﬁnal sample ( n= 1398) is characterised by a mean age of 10.10 (SD = .78) at
baseline and consisting of 52.5% girls and 47.4% boys. The majority was Dutch(98.2%).
Socio-economic status (SES) of parents was assessed by asking parents about their
highest completed education level, which is a regular proxy of SES (Ringlever, Otten,
de Leeuw, & Engels,
2010 ). Levels of education were divided into low (i.e. preparatory
school for technical and vocational training) (25.2%), middle (i.e. intermediate or gen-eral education) (26.6%) and high (i.e. preparatory college and university education)(48.2%). Fourteen per cent of the children had asthma (Table
1).
Sample size
A power calculation indicated that 428 children were needed in both the intervention
and the control condition to ﬁnd a difference of 10% in smoking initiation at 36-month
follow-up: a power of 80%, αof .05.
Randomisation
Each school was randomly allocated to the intervention or control condition; this was
done by an independent statistician (allocation ratio (1:1)). Based on the baseline
assessment, schools were strati ﬁed by the number of asthmatic children. Participants
were blind to randomisation (single-blind trial).
Intervention
The intervention was based on the ‘Smoke-free Kids ’programme developed in the
United States (Jackson & Dickinson, 2003 ,2006 ). This home-based smoking prevention
programme was adapted for the Dutch situation (for more details, Hiemstra et al.,
2009 ). Mothers and children received ﬁve printed activity modules by mail at four-week
intervals. These modules were designed to gradually increase parental skills and com-fort level in communicating with children about smoking, addiction and expectationsregarding abstinence by performing different assignments. Each module included a highconcentration of structured interactions that engages mother and child simultaneously,such as games, scripted role-plays, contests and interviews. Each module intervened ondifferent socialisation variables, including general communication about smoking, theinﬂuence of smoking messages, the setting of rules, smoke-free houses and environ-
ments, the in ﬂuence of smoking friends and the handling of peer pressure (see, e.g.
Hiemstra et al.,
2009 ). All ﬁve activity modules included a communication sheet for
mothers. These sheets provided background information about the subjects discussed inthe modules and communication tips for mothers. Finally, a booster module was deliv-ered 12 months post-baseline (after the post-intervention measure). Mothers wereinstructed that the time investment to read and complete a module takes approximatelyone hour each month.
The control condition received a fact-based programme in order to minimise drop-
out and to be able to follow families over time. The programme was intended to func-
tion as ‘care as usual ’. The factsheets provided information on youth smoking and
directed parents ’attention towards macro-level variables relevant to youth smoking, butPsychology & Health 135

also available in local, state or national media. The mothers received the programmealong with the intervention condition but did not receive a booster.
Secondary outcomes
Smoking-related cognitions
Attitudes towards smoking assessed how children think about daily smoking. Children
were asked with 7 items what they think about daily smoking using the text: ‘I think
that daily smoking is …’Children responded either with (1) negative attitudes, (2) neu-
tral attitudes or (3) positive attitudes. For example: I think that daily smoking is
unhealthy, not unhealthy but also not healthy, or healthy. Negative attitudes were
‘unpleasant ’,‘harmful ’,‘useless ’,‘boring ’,‘dangerous ’,‘unhealthy ’,‘bad’, and positive
attitudes were ‘pleasant ’,‘harmless ’,‘useful ’,‘exciting ’,‘not dangerous ’,‘healthy ’and
‘good ’(Harakeh, Scholte, Vermulst, & Engels,
2004 ). Because of skewed data, the
Omega (McDonald, 1999 ) was calculated instead of the Cronbach ’s alpha. Omega ’s
across waves ranged from .82 to 90. Therefore, a mean score was calculated: a higher
mean score re ﬂected a pro-smoking attitude.
Refusal self -efﬁcacy referred to children ’sc o n ﬁdence in their ability to stay a non-
smoker and to refuse a cigarette (de Vries, Dijkstra, & Kuhlman, 1988 ; Engels, Knibbe,
de Vries, & Drop, 1998 ; Engels, Knibbe, & Drop, 1999 ; Vries, Backbier, Kok, &
Dijkstra, 1995 ). This was measured with six items on a six-point scale ranging from
‘very dif ﬁcult’(1) to ‘very easy ’(6).Some of the items were simpli ﬁed by asking chil-
dren to imagine smoking-related situations, for instance “Imagine: When I am offered a
cigarette, I ﬁnd it dif ﬁcult/easy to refuse ”.Other examples are ‘For me it is dif ﬁcult/
easy to stay a non-smoker ’,‘Iﬁnd it dif ﬁcult/easy to explain to other people that I do
not want to smoke ’. A higher score indicated higher ef ﬁcacy to refuse a cigarette.
Omega ’s across waves ranged from .84 to 88.
Social Norms assessed children ’s perceptions of the extent to which mothers, friends
and best friends would approve of their smoking behaviour (e.g. Vries et al., 1995 )
using three items: ‘Do you think your friends/your best friend/your mother would
approve when you smoke (or would smoke)? ’Responses were measured on a
four-point scale ranging from ‘deﬁnitely not ’(1) to ‘deﬁnitely ’(4).
Analyses
Weﬁrst examined whether randomisation was successful. Therefore, we tested the dif-
ferences between the intervention and control condition at baseline for the covariates(i.e. gender, age, ethnicity child and mother, smoking behaviour parents, SES andasthma) and the smoking-related cognitions using SPSS 19.0. Signi ﬁcant differences
between the intervention and control condition were found for gender (OR = 1.46, 95%CI = 1.16 –1.83, p= .001) and asthma (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.02 –1.98, p= .04)
(Table
1).1Therefore, analyses on the effects of the programme were corrected for gen-
der and asthma. Loss to follow-up was examined with logistic attrition analyses using36-month follow-up as outcome, covariates, smoking-related cognitions, and conditionas predictors.138 M. Hiemstra et al.

The effectiveness analyses were conducted in two stages. First, individual develop-
ment of smoking-related cognitions over time was estimated with latent growth analysisusing Mplus 5.0 (Muthén & Muthén,
1998 –2004 ). The parameters in the models were
estimated applying the maximum likelihood estimator with Robust standard errors due tothe skewness of the distribution of the model variables. We also corrected for nested data
within schools via the CLUSTER command in combination with TYPE = COMPLEX
procedure. With this method, standard errors of the estimated parameters are correctedfor dependency, resulting in unbiased estimates. To ﬁnd the best ﬁt for all unconditional
latent growth curves, we ran a linear (i.e. intercept and slope) and a quadratic model.4,44,64,855,25,45,6

In all analyses, model ﬁt was assessed by chi-square values (df), the Comparative ﬁt
index (CFI), Tucker –Lewis index (TLI) and the root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA) (McDonald & Ho, 2002 ). Missing values were handled by using full informa-
tion maximum likelihood (Muthén & Muthén, 1998 –2004 ).
For attitudes and social norms of friends, best friend and mother, a good linear
model (i.e. initial level and growth across time) ﬁt was found. For self-ef ﬁcacy, a quad-
ratic model ﬁt the data more optimally (i.e. rate of acceleration) (Table 2). Second, to
estimate the in ﬂuence of the intervention on adolescents ’initial level and linear growth
(and for self-ef ﬁcacy rate of acceleration), path modelling was used separately for each
smoking-related cognition. These analyses were corrected for baseline differences ofasthma and gender.

control conditions. Repeated measures indicated that the change of mothers perceived
social norms differed signi ﬁcantly between the control and intervention conditions
(Wilks ’Δ= .98, F(4-1104) = 4.89, p= .001). No differences in the attitudes,
self-ef ﬁcacy and social norms of friends and best friends were found.
Effect on smoking-related cognitions
Table 3depicts the relations between the intervention and the initial level and the
development of smoking-related cognitions. Results showed that the intervention condi-tion was signi ﬁcantly related to the slope of the social norms of mothers ( β=−.10,
p= .03). This indicates that for children in the intervention condition, the perceived
maternal norms regarding their smoking behaviour increased less strong than for chil-
dren in the control condition, with lower perceived maternal norms indicating lower
likelihood to expect maternal approval. No intervention effects were found on the initiallevel and the development of attitudes, self-ef ﬁcacy or social norms of friends and best
friends.
Discussion
This study evaluated the long-term secondary effects of a home-based smoking preven-
tion programme ‘Smoke-free Kids ’on children ’s smoking-related cognitions (i.e. atti-
tudes, self-ef ﬁcacy, social norms of friends, best friends and mother) using a cluster
randomised controlled trial. We found that the Smoke-free Kids prevention programmehad an effect on the development of the perceived maternal social norm on smoking.For attitudes, self-ef ﬁcacy and social norms of friends and best friends, no signi ﬁcant
programme effects were found.
The effect of the programme on maternal social norms indicates that, compared to
children in the control condition, more children in the intervention believed that their
mother would be more likely to disapprove their smoking behaviour. An explanation
for the fact that the social norms of mothers had changed in response to the interven-tion, whereas those of friends and best friends had not, could be due to the fact thatchildren work through the programme together with their mother. Children talk withtheir mother about smoking during the programme and become more aware of theirmothers ’ideas about smoking-related topics. This is likely not the case for peers
because only a small percentage of friends were smoking at this age.
An explanation of the absence of the effect of attitudes is that children already had
very negative beliefs towards smoking before the start of the programme. Previous stud-
ies show that ideas about smoking are formed early in life, long before children startusing cigarettes (e.g. Leventhal & Cleary,
1980 ). Our results are similar to those from
other studies in which children reported very negative attitudes towards smoking (Hahnet al.,
2000 ; Porcellato, Dugdill, & Springett, 2005 ; Porcellato, Dugdill, Springett, &
Sanderson, 1999 ). We also did not ﬁnd an effect for self-ef ﬁcacy. We did ﬁnd an effect
after 6 months ; however, this was in contrast with our expectations. Directly after the
intervention, self-ef ﬁcacy was lower in the intervention condition than in the control
condition (Hiemstra et al., 2013 ). After 36 months, the level of individual self-ef ﬁcacy
was again similar in both conditions. Speci ﬁcally, in both intervention and control
condition, we found that self-ef ﬁcacy skills increased over time. An explanation for this142 M. Hiemstra et al.
ﬁnding could be that self-ef ﬁcacy develops through observation (e.g. Bandura, 1992 ),
and children at primary school age may be too young to encounter situations in which
they need to use smoking refusal skills. However, when they transfer to secondary
school, this is likely to change because they increasingly engage in situations where
other peers smoke. Based on the above-mentioned results and the non-signi ﬁcantﬁnd-
ings of the Smoke-free Kids programme on smoking onset (Hiemstra et al., 2014 ), we
do not expect a delayed effect on smoking later during adolescence. Therefore, andbased on results of previous prevention programmes in elementary schools (e.g. Croneet al.,
2011; Elek et al., 2010 ; Marsiglia et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011), we do not
recommend to conduct a prevention programme for children at this speci ﬁc age group.
To gain more insight in what parents think about smoking prevention, it is important
that we learn more about the timing, the setting and the content that smoking
prevention programmes should have. Qualitative research involving interviews and
focus groups could be a valuable ﬁrst step.
In addition, the Smoke-free Kids programme focused on parenting strategies. To
gain more insight into the communication between mother and child while talking aboutsmoking, observations should be performed (i.e. Wakschlag et al.,
2011). Observations
will inform us about the different communication strategies in real life. In order to gaininsight into the development of smoking-related cognitions, these observations could beconducted repeatedly embedded in a longitudinal design.
Furthermore, future smoking prevention may bene ﬁt more from a broader and more
holistic approach, in which anti-smoking messages are not limited to the home environ-ment and prevention efforts should occur at family level, school level andcommunity
level. Only this way, norms regarding smoking in children can be changed. Therefore,future programmes should exist of multiple components that ﬁt carefully together in
order to optimise their effectiveness (e.g. a home-based programme combined with aschool prevention programme, embedded in a larger community-based programme, bymeans of a strong mass media campaign [Pentz,
1999 ]).
Furthermore, prevention aimed at children in elementary school may be too far
removed from the actual moment of smoking onset, which occurs mostly halfwaythrough secondary school (i.e. age 14 –16). Future studies should focus on programmes
closer to the age of smoking onset, concentrating on 11- to 13 year-old children, includ-ing the transition phase between elementary and secondary school.
Some limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, generalisability to the
larger population is limited since we used a sample consisting of families who voluntar-ily signed up for the study. The ﬁndings are mainly generalisable to participants who
are interested in anti-smoking socialisation. Future studies should focus more on at-risk
populations (e.g. low SES, smoking parents). To reach lower SES children, it would beessential to focus on prevention programmes at schools. At schools, prevention effortscould focus on all children of different SES. Second, children reported about their ownsmoking-related cognitions, which introduce the possibility of under- or over-reportingbecause of social desirability. To overcome this potential weakness, implicit measuresof attitudes could be used (de Leeuw, Engels, & Scholte,
2010 ) and compared with
explicit attitudes (Sherman, Chassin, Presson, Seo, & Macy, 2009 ). Third, all measures
were assessed by means of self-report. Chemical validation of, for instance, smoking
initiation was not possible due to ﬁnancial and logistic limitations. Finally, for practical
reasons, the programme focused on mothers instead of both parents. Previous researchPsychology & Health 143
indicates differences between fathers and mothers in communication about smoking,
suggesting that mothers are more positive about anti-smoking socialisation than fathers(Engels & Willemsen,
2004 ; Harakeh, Scholte, de Vries, & Engels, 2005 ). In future
research, fathers should be taken into account, as they may affect the effectiveness of
prevention programmes in families.
In conclusion, the only programme effect we found was on the perceived smoking
norms of mothers. Speci ﬁcally, we found that mothers in the intervention condition
were less positive towards smoking as compared to those in the control condition.Based on these results, we do not expect the Smoke-free Kids programme to have adelayed effect on smoking behaviour later during adolescence.
