Abstract 
Background Drastic increases in the rates of maternal depression and anxiety have been reported since the COVID ‑
19 pandemic began. Most programs aim to improve maternal mental health or parenting skills separately, despite 
it being more effective to target both concurrently. The Building Emotional Awareness and Mental health (BEAM) 
program was developed to address this gap. BEAM is a mobile health program aiming to mitigate the impacts of pan‑
demic stress on family well‑being. Since many family agencies lack infrastructure and personnel to adequately treat 
maternal mental health concerns, a partnership will occur with Family Dynamics (a local family agency) to address this 
unmet need. The study’s objective is to examine the feasibility of the BEAM program when delivered with a commu‑
nity partner to inform a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT).
Methods A pilot RCT will be conducted with mothers who have depression and/or anxiety with a child 6–18 months 
old living in Manitoba, Canada. Mothers will be randomized to the 10 weeks of the BEAM program or a standard of 
care (i.e., MoodMission). Back ‑end App data (collected via Google Analytics and Firebase) will be used to examine 
feasibility, engagement, and accessibility of the BEAM program; cost ‑effectiveness will also be examined. Implemen‑
tation elements (e.g., maternal depression [Patient Health Questionnaire ‑9] and anxiety [Generalized Anxiety Disor ‑
der‑7]) will be piloted to estimate the effect size and variance for future sample size calculations.
Discussion In partnership with a local family agency, BEAM holds the potential to promote maternal‑ child health via 
a cost ‑effective and an easily accessible program designed to scale. Results will provide insight into the feasibility of 
the BEAM program and will inform future RCTs.

Introduction
Background and rationale {6a–b}
Maternal depression and anxiety have dramatically 
increased during the COVID-19 pandemic [1]. A meta-
analysis documented that 26.9 and 41.9% of mothers 
experience clinically significant depression and anxiety 
symptoms, respectively [2]. Key risk factors associated 
with increased maternal mental health concerns include 
stressors associated with isolation, domestic conflict, 
and a lack of parenting support [1, 3]. The absence of 
standard mental health screening and a backlog of exist -
ing mental health services suggests most mothers do not 
have access to evidence-based mental health treatments 
[4, 5]. In Canada, only 1 in 10 mothers receive adequate 
postpartum mental health care, resulting in persistence 
of problems, enormous individual and societal economic 
impact, as well as child mental health concerns and 
developmental impairments [6–9]. The national WeCan -
ForKids report highlighted a need to address maternal 
mental health even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic 
[10]. With significant elevations in maternal depression 
and anxiety compared to pre-pandemic rates [1], there 
is now a critical need to mitigate the impact of maternal 
mental health concerns among at-risk families to reduce 
negative sequelae.
Existing therapies are insufficient to address fam -
ily mental health needs. Programs designed to improve 
parent mental health and parenting skills separately 
have small effects with minimal improvements in the 
past 20  years [11]. Although programs addressing both 
mother and child mental health have 50% larger effects 
than treating either alone, these programs are typically 
costly, require extensively trained clinicians, and have 
lengthy waitlists, in turn impeding program scalability 
and ability to meet maternal mental health needs [12]. 
Early models of mobile health (mHealth) programs show 
promise for treating depression and anxiety but are rarely 
targeted toward mothers and have high dropout rates 
[13, 14]. Further, mHealth is typically delivered by a third 
party, without consulting trusted community agencies 
who hold key knowledge of local needs, can appraise risk, 
and offer additional support if required.
The Building Emotional Awareness and Mental health 
(BEAM) program is a mHealth program designed to mitigate the impacts of stress on family mental health 
and the program’s feasibility is ready to be tested in 
partnership with an established community agency. The 
BEAM program was co-designed with a patient advisory 
board (PAB, i.e., mothers with lived experience managing 
depression and/or who have completed a previous trial 
[15]) based on identified priorities of connecting thera -
pists and mothers in a secure online setting. The BEAM 
platform enables the merger of telehealth best practices 
with peer connection. Key elements of the BEAM pro -
gram include the following: (a) expert-led psychoeduca -
tional videos adapted from the Unified Protocol (UP), an 
evidence-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for depres -
sion, anxiety, and associated disorders [16–18], as well 
as emotion-focused parenting strategies [15]; (b) struc -
tured telehealth (videoconferencing) group sessions to 
consolidate therapeutic content and build social support 
[19, 20]; (c) a monitored online forum to enhance peer 
connection; (d) symptom monitoring to track progress 
[21]; and (e) suggested assignments such as reflections 
and practice exercises. BEAM is therapist-led to increase 
adherence, consistent with evidence that guided mHealth 
therapy is more effective than unguided [22]. The BEAM 
program holds strong potential as a scalable model that 
can be readily adapted to meet maternal needs, specifi -
cally among underserved populations.
Family agencies typically lack the infrastructure 
and personnel capacities to adequately treat maternal 
mental health concerns [23], with this gap in services 
being stark in Manitoba, Canada, where mothers wait 
12–18  months for therapy on provincial public health 
waitlists. At our partner agency, Family Dynamics, par -
enting coaches find untreated maternal depression and 
anxiety to be primary in-home risk factors that impede 
the efficacy of parenting interventions. Providing 
BEAM training and consultation will enable coaches 
to provide expert-led mental health treatment to sup -
plement and expand upon existing services. Our part -
nership approach with Family Dynamics will allow for 
the assessment of the BEAM program’s feasibility when 
delivered with a community partner.
Our pilot, non-superiority trial of the BEAM program 
among mothers of toddlers (N  = 65) found clinically 
significant change in 66.7% of mothers with persis -
tent depression (anxiety symptoms were not assessed) 
[24]. Qualitative feedback suggests high acceptability 
(e.g., “[BEAM] was so helpful in establishing how to 
accomplish my goal. I also enjoyed getting to know the 
group via zoom and feel much more comfortable chat -
ting in the forum”; “[BEAM] made me feel less alone in 
the issues I am facing personally, mental health wise, 
and in parenting”). This trial was not conducted with 
Page 4 of 14 Joyce et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:35 
mothers of infants and did not include a partnership 
with an established community agency, however. To 
inform scalability efforts, further research is needed to 
determine the feasibility of the BEAM program when 
delivered in collaboration with a community agency. 
Following the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention 
Trials (ORBIT) model for developing behavioral treat -
ments for chronic disease [25, 26], our team will com -
plete a feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 
the BEAM program. Implementation elements (e.g., 
maternal depression and anxiety) will be examined to 
estimate effect size and variance for future sample size 
calculations and will be compared to a Standard of Care 
(SOC), i.e., MoodMission. MoodMission was chosen as 
the SOC as this program has been rigorously studied 
using RCTs, which is rare for a mHealth app and shows 
a decrease in moderate depressive and anxiety symp -
toms post-intervention [27– 30].
Objectives {7}
Aim 1
To examine the feasibility of the BEAM program when 
delivered by a community agency. Feasibility indicators 
include recruitment rate, retention rate, and perceived 
usefulness of BEAM, for example.
Aim 2
To assess preliminary implementation elements of the 
BEAM program to estimate effect size and variance for 
future sample size calculations (treatment effect) and 
compare the BEAM program to SOC [28] in primary 
clinical outcomes including maternal depression and 
anxiety (treatment response).
Trial design {8}
A two-armed, parallel-design RCT will occur where par -
ticipants receive the 10-week app-based BEAM program 
(mental health and parenting treatment) or MoodMis -
sion (mental health treatment only). Mothers will be ran -
domized to the BEAM or MoodMission program with 
a 1:1 allocation as per a computer-generated randomi -
zation schedule stratified by participant availability for 
weekly group telehealth sessions. Self-reported repeated 
measures data will be collected online via Research Elec -
tronic Data Capture (REDCap) [31] from mothers in 
both programs. Back-end BEAM App data will be col -
lected via Google Analytics and Firebase. Assessments 
will occur at three timepoints: pre-intervention (T1), 
post-intervention (T2), and 6-month follow-up (T3). 
Amendments to the study protocol will be submitted 
to the Research Ethics Board (REB) at the University of 
Manitoba who will review and approve amendments prior to implementation. Participants will re-consent to 
amendments, if required. Any amendments will also be 
submitted as updates on ClinicalTrials.gov.
This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT05398107) and will follow Standard Protocol Items: 
Recommendations for Intervention Trials (SPIRIT) 
guidelines [32, 33]. All procedures will be performed 
in accordance with the University of Manitoba’s REB 
(HE2021-0217) and the Helsinki Declaration. Partici -
pants will provide electronic informed consent prior to 
study enrollment.
Methods: participants, interventions, 
and outcomes
Study setting {9}
Participants will reside in Manitoba, Canada. Manitoba is 
in the center of Canada and has a population of 1.3 mil -
lion. Recent results from a predominantly Manitoban 
sample of mothers with children 0–18  months old sug -
gested significantly elevated rates of depression and/or 
anxiety since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic [1].
Participant identification and consent
Participants will be recruited using online social media 
advertisements (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, 
Reddit), posters in Manitoba, Canada, and poster-sharing 
via Family Dynamics listserv. Informed consent will be 
collected electronically from all mothers on three occa -
sions, before (a) the eligibility screener, (b) the MINI [34], 
and (c) beginning study participation. The consent pro -
cesses will be documented using REDCap [31]. If funding 
is obtained for long-term follow-up, further consent will 
be obtained.
Eligibility criteria {10}
Participants must (a) identify as a mother (i.e., bio -
logical, adoptive, foster, step-mother, or another type 
of woman-identifying primary caregiver), (b) have a 
child between 6 and 18 months old at recruitment, (c) 
be 18 years old or above, (d) reside in Manitoba, Can -
ada, with access to a cellular network, (e) score > 9 on 
the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) [35] 
and/or the General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-
7) [36], (f) complete a psychodiagnostic mental health 
assessment (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inter -
view; MINI) [34] and pre-intervention survey before 
randomization, (g) meet criteria for a major depressive 
episode and/or anxiety disorder (i.e., panic disorder, 
agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, or generalized 
anxiety disorder) as assessed by the MINI, (h) be avail -
able to attend weekly telehealth groups, and (i) be com -
fortable understanding, reading, and speaking English.

 Joyce et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:35 
 
Exclusion criteria include: (a) a suicide attempt in the 
past year, (b) self-harm in the past 6 months, and/or (c) 
clinically significant psychotic symptoms, posttraumatic 
stress disorder, or alcohol/substance use disorder (iden -
tified on the MINI  34) which, based on clinical judge -
ment, would make it unlikely for the individual to attend 
weekly group telehealth sessions and/or make treatment 
gains. The BEAM and MoodMission programs are not 
suitable to treat these acute mental health needs and as 
such mothers deemed ineligible for these reasons will 
be provided with local mental health resources more 
appropriate for their needs.
Participant timeline {13}
See Table  1 for the SPIRIT schedule of enrolment, inter -
ventions, and assessments  and additional file  1 for the 
SPIRIT Checklist.
Enrollment (weeks 1–8)
Eligibility screener Mothers will complete an online 
questionnaire to determine eligibility. This questionnaire 
will include an author-compiled sociodemographic and 
suicidality/self-harm questionnaire as well as the PHQ-9 
[35] and GAD-7 [36]. These questionnaires will determine 
whether they meet preliminary inclusion criteria.
Psychodiagnostic mental health assessment If deemed 
eligible on the eligibility screener, mothers will be invited 
to complete a psychodiagnostics mental health assess -
ment (i.e., MINI) [34] with trained research personnel via 
Zoom. The following modules of the MINI will be admin -
istered: major depressive episode, suicidality, panic disor -
der, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic 
stress disorder, alcohol use disorder, substance use dis -order, psychotic disorders and mood disorders with psy -
chotic features, and generalized anxiety disorder. Mothers 
meeting criteria for a major depressive episode and/or an 
anxiety disorder (i.e., panic disorder, agoraphobia, social 
anxiety disorder, and/or generalized anxiety disorder) will 
be deemed eligible once they complete the pre-interven -
tion survey and consent to randomization. Those who do 
not meet inclusion criteria will be provided with a list of 
local mental health resources.
Pre-intervention questionnaires All mothers deemed 
eligible to participate will be invited to complete a series 
of questionnaires via RedCap to assess baseline data of 
interest before allocation. See Table  2 for specific ques -
tionnaires.
Interventions (weeks 9–19) {11a}
The BEAM and MoodMission App-based programs 
will be offered via mobile device (both are functional on 
Android and iOS platforms). Participants will be pro -
vided with a mobile device, if required.
The Building Emotional Awareness and  Mental Health 
Program (Intervention Group) The BEAM program 
was designed to promote intergenerational well-being 
through the treatment of maternal mental illness and pre -
venting child mental health concerns, by integrating par -
enting and self-compassion skills with UP modules [16, 
18]. The interrelated skills are designed to increase sup -
portive parenting behaviors and promote maternal-child 
bonding to disrupt each of the theorized mechanisms of 
environmental risk transmission (e.g., positive emotional 
modelling, improved relationships, support for children’s 
distress, reduced conflict [15, 37]).

The BEAM program is a 10-week guided mental 
health and parenting program where participants move 
through modules with a cohort of other mothers expe -
riencing depression and/or anxiety. Each week includes 
10–30  min of psychoeducational video content, weekly 
mood tracking, a 1-hour weekly group telehealth ses -
sion with content review and facilitated discussions in 
breakout rooms, access to an online forum to cultivate peer support, and assignments to practice key skills. The 
BEAM program content has been developed in collabo -
ration with our PAB and the Family Dynamics team.

psychologist), parent coaches from Family Dynamics, 
and a peer coach. Parent coaches are mental health staff  
(trained paraprofessionals) from Family Dynamics. Peer 
coaches are mothers who recently completed a program 
targeting their own mental health needs and who have 
agreed to help promote maternal mental wellness [15]. 
Clinical coaches will lead/co-lead weekly group telehealth 
sessions, manage participant contact via email/phone, 
and participate in weekly supervision meetings with clin -
ical psychologists. Parent and peer coaches will partici -
pate in weekly group telehealth sessions and engage with 
participants on the online community forum.
Psychoeducation
The BEAM program will include psychoeducational 
materials consisting of separate weekly videos on mental 
health and parenting skills. These videos will be approxi -
mately 5 to 15 min long each (totaling 10 to 30 min per 
week). Mental health videos will provide easily digestible 
information on emotion regulation strategies adapted 
from the UP , an evidence-based transdiagnostic treat -
ment for depressive and anxiety disorders [16, 18], and 
will focus on self-compassion skills. Parenting skill videos 
will teach emotion-focused and behavior management 
strategies to help mothers understand and co-regulate 
their child’s challenging behaviors. Videos will also teach 
mothers how to prevent negative mother–child interac -
tions and promote positive relationships.
Mood tracking
Brief weekly questionnaires on depression (Patient 
Health Questionnaire-2 Item; PHQ-2) [38], anxiety 
(Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 Item; GAD-2) [39], par -
enting stress (modified version of the Parenting Stress 
Index; PSI-4) [40], and positive mood (modified version 
of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale; PANAS-2) [41] 
will be sent to participants. Scores for each questionnaire 
will be provided, allowing mothers to track their weekly 
scores. Mood tracking is shown to promote emotional 
understanding [42].
Weekly group telehealth sessions
Weekly group telehealth sessions will provide mothers 
with the opportunity to discuss program material with 
coaches and peers, ask questions, and gain a sense of 
community. There will be three telehealth groups with 
different schedules to accommodate as many mothers as 
possible.
Online community forum
An online community forum will provide mothers with 
the opportunity to reflect on learned skills from the 
BEAM weekly modules and access social support by connecting with other mothers in the program. This will 
be a confidential, closed forum overseen by peer and par -
ent coaches. The forum will consist of open-ended dis -
cussions between participants, peer advice, and sharing 
of anecdotes/non-identifying photos of their wellness 
journey. Mothers will be able to ask parent and peer 
coaches mental health- and parenting-related questions.
MoodMission (Standard of Care Group) The SOC arm 
will receive MoodMission, an App-based program effec -
tive in the treatment of moderate depression and anxiety 
in adults and increasing their well-being [27–30]. Mood -
Mission uses an adaptive learning algorithm based on 
self-reported level of distress during prior engagement. 
Based on this algorithm, participants are provided with 
five targeted cognitive-behavioral therapy strategies to 
build self-efficacy. Compared to BEAM, this self-paced 
generalized service is not tailored to the complex needs 
faced by parents and lacks coaching, social support, and 
parenting skills development. MoodMission was chosen 
as the SOC because it has been rigorously studied using 
RCTs [ 27–30]. Those in the MoodMission group will work 
through program content on the App at their own pace.
Post‑intervention questionnaires (weeks 19–21)
Mothers will be given 2 weeks to complete the post-inter -
vention questionnaires via RedCap after the BEAM and 
MoodMission programs are complete (see Tables  1 and 
2). Participants will be invited to complete these ques -
tionnaires regardless of program completion.
Follow‑up questionnaires (weeks 32–34)
Approximately 6 months following program completion, 
mothers will be sent a series of follow-up questionnaires 
via RedCap (see Tables 1 and 2).
Compensation
Mothers will be compensated a total of $160/Cana -
dian Dollars ($50 for enrollment [$25 for a psy -
chodiagnostic mental health assessment and $25 for 
pre-intervention surveys], $50 for the post-interven -
tion questionnaires, $25 for the follow-up question -
naires, $25 for participants who complete > 75% of 
the weekly surveys, and $10 for those who complete 
the post-intervention questionnaire within 1 week of

Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated 
interventions {11b}
Clinical coaches will receive an alert from REDCap [31] if 
suicidality items are endorsed during the pre-intervention, 
post-intervention, or follow-up surveys [i.e., endorsing 
“Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting 
yourself in some way” on the PHQ-9 [35] or a 2 + on any 
items on the Depression Severity Index—Suicidality Sub -
scale (DSI-SS) [43]] and/or during the psychodiagnostics 
mental health assessment. These alerts will prompt clini -
cal coaches to take necessary steps to assess participant 
safety and provide appropriate intervention. The clinical 
team will consult on any instances of suicidality to deter -
mine whether it is in the participant’s best interest to 
continue in the study. Of those in the BEAM program, 
participants may have discontinued access to the online 
community forum and/or denied access to weekly group 
telehealth sessions if they repeatedly violate terms of use. 
Further, if a participant cannot maintain the confidential -
ity of others during weekly group telehealth sessions, they 
may be denied access. In the above case, participants will 
still have access to all psychoeducational materials on the 
BEAM app and will be invited to complete all question -
naires. Clinical coaches would also provide referrals to 
other clinicians and clinics, if appropriate.
Strategies to improve adherence and intervention 
protocols {11c}
Once a mother is randomized, all efforts will be made to 
follow the participant for the study duration. A recent 
iteration of BEAM for mothers of children 18–36 months 
old had an 83.7% retention rate (16.3% lost to follow-up) 
[44]. First, mothers will be asked to confirm their avail -
ability for weekly group telehealth sessions on the eligi -
bility screener and will participate in a Zoom orientation 
with a parent coach. Second, participants in the BEAM 
program will receive three weekly push notifications via 
the BEAM App as well as a weekly reminder via email. 
Engagement notifications contribute to increased men -
tal health benefits of mHealth interventions [45]. Third, 
those in the BEAM program will also be contacted by 
their clinical coach if they have not attended a weekly tel -
ehealth group session. Fourth, compensation will be pro -
vided across study participation (see below) to encourage 
completion; participants will be encouraged to complete 
questionnaires regardless of program completion.
Outcomes {12}
Pre-specified success criteria are identified in Table  3. All 
feasibility indicators will be dichotomized into success or 
revise. “Success” indicates the protocol can move forward 
with a larger RCT with no/little revisions required, while 
“revise” suggests changes are needed prior to proceeding.Aim 1
Back-end App data, collected via Google Analytics and 
Firebase, will be used to assess recommended mHealth 
engagement variables [46, 47]: (a) number of logins and 
sessions to the BEAM app, (b) number of forum posts, (c) 
time spent on the BEAM app and on the forum, (d) num -
ber of videos watched/time spent watching videos, and 
(e) number of weeks between first and last engagement 
with the app. Weekly telehealth group session attendance 
(yes/no) will be compiled by the clinical team. Analyt -
ics and group attendance data will also be used to assess 
retention (number of weeks completed) and completion 
(participating in > 50% of program weeks by either log -
ging onto the BEAM app or attending the weekly group 
telehealth session). Finally, the mHealth App Usability 
Questionnaire (MAUQ) [48] will assess participants’ 
views on the BEAM program.
Aim 2
Data on maternal depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-
7) will be used to estimate effect size for a future large-scale 
RCT and to assess preliminary mean change in variables of 
interest across assessment timepoints. The PHQ-9 includes 
[35] nine items which will ask mothers the severity of their 
depressive symptoms during the past 2 weeks. The PHQ-9 
has high internal consistency (α  = 0.88) [49]. Anxiety symp -
tom severity will be assessed using the GAD-7, a seven-item 
measure which will ask mothers their degree of anxiety 
symptoms over the past 2 weeks. The GAD-7 has excellent 
internal consistency (α  = 0.92) [36]. Items on both scales are 
scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (“Not at all”) 
to 3 (“Nearly every day”) where higher summative scores 
suggest more problematic symptoms.
Additional questionnaires will assess maternal mental 
health (i.e., Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System [PROMIS] Anger [PROMIS-A] [50] 
and Sleep Disturbance [PROMIS-SD] [51] subscales, 
Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test [AUDIT] [52] 
Cannabis use Disorder Identification Test – Revised 
[CUDIT-R] [53], Substance Use Motives Measure—Cop -
ing Subscales [SUMM] [54], and Depression Severity 
Index—Suicidality Subscale [DSI-SS] [43]), parenting 
(i.e., Parenting Stress Index – Short Form [PSI-SF] [40], 
Perceived Maternal Parenting Self-Efficacy [PMP S-E] 
[55], and the Parenting Scale—Overreactivity Subscale 
[56], Couples Satisfaction Inventory 4-Item [CSI-4] [57]), 
and child outcomes (i.e., Ages and Stages Questionnaire: 
Social-Emotional Challenges – 2 [ASQ:SE-2] [58], Pedi -
atric Quality of Life Inventory [PedsQL] [59], and Infant 
Behavior Questionnaire – Revised – Very Short Form—
Effortful Control Subscale [IBQ-R-VS] [60]).
Data on sociodemographic characteristics will be col -
lected in the pre- and/or post-intervention questionnaires 
Page 9 of 14
 Joyce et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:35 
 
including (a) maternal demographics (e.g., age, marital 
status, highest level of education, ethnicity, employment, 
depression persistence, anxiety persistence), (b) child demo -
graphics (e.g., child sex, age of child), and (c) household 
demographics (e.g., number of adults and children in the 
household, annual household income, community type).
Other variables known to impact adult mental health 
and child development will be collected including the 
Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Questionnaire, 
the author-compiled Recent Stressful Experiences Ques -
tionnaire (RSE; developed based on recommendations 
from the JPB research network on toxic stress at Har -
vard’s Center on the Developing Child) [61], and the 
author-compiled Emergency Health and Social Service 
Utilization Questionnaire.
Tracking of concomitant care during the trial {11d}
Participants will be permitted to receive concomitant 
care during study involvement. Concomitant care (e.g., 
medication, psychotherapy) will be measured during the 
post-intervention and follow-up surveys (i.e., “During the 
past 3  months, did you access any other mental health 
and/or parenting resources?” , “What resources did you 
access for mental health and/or parenting?” , and “How 
effective do you think these resources were?”).Sample size {14}
As this is a pilot and feasibility study, a sample size 
calculation is not appropriate. However, our target 
sample size of 30 participants per group is consist -
ent with prior recommendations and will provide 
data to sufficiently establish BEAM feasibility [62, 
63]. Accounting for a conservative 30% attrition rate 
[24], we will recruit an additional 10 participants per 
group (N  = 80). With an estimated BEAM sample size 
of 40 mothers, we aim to achieve questionnaire com -
pletion and retention rates of 80% to within a 95% 
confidence interval of ± 12.4% as well as a treatment 
adherence rate of 50% to within a 95% confidence 
interval of ± 15.5%.
Methods: assignment of interventions
Allocation {16a–c}
Mothers will be randomized to the BEAM or Mood -
Mission program with a 1:1 allocation. Randomization 
will occur in blocks of 10 using a computer-generated 
randomization schedule (http:// www. rando mlists. com/ 
team- gener ator) stratified by participant availability for 
weekly group telehealth sessions. To conceal allocation 
sequence, randomization will occur once 10 mothers 
have been deemed eligible.Table 3 Feasibility indicators

Page 10 of 14 Joyce et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:35 
Blinding {17a–b}
A research assistant unaffiliated with the BEAM clinical 
team will be responsible for conducting central randomi -
zation for participants who have agreed to participate 
and have received their identification number (i.e., fol -
lowing completion of pre-intervention questionnaires). 
The enrollment of mothers to the proposed study and 
their allocation to BEAM versus SOC will be com -
pleted by two separate research assistants. The research 
assistant designating treatment condition will have no 
interaction with participants (i.e., not on the BEAM 
clinical team). Trial participants, clinical coaches, parent 
coaches, and peer coaches will not be blinded to treat -
ment condition given the behavioral nature of the treat -
ment provided. Data analysts also will not be blinded to 
treatment condition.
Methods: data collection, management, 
and analysis
Data collection methods {18a–b}
An outline of all questionnaires to be used is presented in 
Table  2. Once a mother is randomized, all efforts will be 
made to follow the participant for the study duration. A 
recent iteration of BEAM for mothers of toddlers had an 
83.7% retention rate [65], suggesting high retention rates 
are likely. Since this RCT will include an intent-to-treat 
analysis, participants will be encouraged to complete 
questionnaires regardless of program completion. Partic -
ipants may withdraw from the study at any time, and the 
investigators may withdraw a participant to protect them 
and/or others in the program or if the study is terminated 
prior to the planned end date.
Data management {19}
Participants will enter questionnaire responses in RED -
Cap [ 31] which is managed by the Centre for Healthcare 
Innovation in Winnipeg, Manitoba, who are consult -
ants on the proposed project. An administrative backup 
for roll-back purposes will occur daily, and data will be 
exported weekly and housed on an encrypted drive. Data 
quality checks will be conducted prior to analyses (e.g., 
range checks for data values). Data will be stored on a 
secure server in accordance with policies of the Univer -
sity of Manitoba’s REB and Personal Health Information 
Act (PHIA) policies.
Statistical methods {20a}
All analyses will be conducted using IBM Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Descriptive sta -
tistics will be computed for the total sample and between 
the two groups (i.e., BEAM and MoodMission) for demo -
graphics and outcome measures at pre-intervention.Aim 1
Descriptive statistics from back-end App data, telehealth 
group attendance, and questionnaires (i.e., BEAM App-
Based, BEAM Forum, BEAM Perceived Social Support, 
BEAM Zoom Telehealth Group, mHealth App Usability, 
and MoodMission App-Based) will be used to examine 
program feasibility, engagement, and acceptability.
Aim 2
Data on maternal depression (PHQ-9) [35] and anxi -
ety (GAD-7) [36] will be used to estimate effect size 
and variance for future sample size calculations. Pre -
liminary analyses will also examine treatment effects 
on outcomes of interest (e.g., depression, anxiety). A 
longitudinal analysis of covariance, using linear mixed 
modelling, will be conducted to preliminarily test treat -
ment effects on outcomes of interest. Treatment effects 
will be tested using two-way interactions between time 
and group assignment. Baseline moderation by symp -
tom severity will be assessed to determine whether 
the BEAM program helps reduce symptoms for moth -
ers with higher levels of depression and anxiety at pre-
intervention compared to MoodMission. An α  of 0.05 
will determine statistical significance. Aggregate vari -
ables will be computed, by converting each measure to 
a standardized z -score then taking the average. Results 
will be reported as means and 95% confidence intervals 
for all comparisons. Bonferroni corrections are consid -
ered very conservative [64], and it has been suggested 
that correction may not be necessary, particularly if the 
study purpose is exploratory [65].
Additional analyses {20b}
A separate subgroup analysis will be conducted with 
mothers who report at-risk substance use. This analysis 
will assess outcomes among mothers with at-risk sub -
stance use in the BEAM program and MoodMission. 
Between- and within-group differences will be examined 
among mothers with at-risk substance use (an 8 + on the 
AUDIT and/or CUDIT-R52,53) and non-problematic 
substance use (< 8 on the AUDIT/CUDIT-R52,53). An 
examination of demographics on feasibility data and a 
longitudinal analysis of covariance (as described above) 
will also be conducted.
Definition of analysis population related to protocol 
non-adherence and methods to handle missing data {20c}
An intent-to-treat analysis will be conducted where 
missing data will be handled using full information 
maximum likelihood estimation [66]. Sensitivity analy -
ses will be conducted by re-running analyses with com -
pleters only [67].

Methods: monitoring
Composition of the data monitoring committee, its role 
and reporting structure {21a}
The current trial does not require a formal data moni -
toring committee given the minimal risk, short dura -
tion, and small sample size. The trial will be monitored 
by the primary investigators who will review each 
phase of the trial including recruitment, randomiza -
tion, intervention, and data collection. Weekly meet -
ings will occur with all clinical and research personnel 
to discuss and resolve questions/concerns and ensure 
consistent implementation.
Interim analyses and stopping guidelines {21b}
No interim analyses are planned.
Plans for collecting, assessing, reporting, and managing 
adverse events and harms {22}
No adverse experiences have occurred during the prior 
BEAM pilot study [24]. If participants report suicidality 
and/or self-harm risk, the clinical team will be notified. A 
risk management protocol will be in place where follow-
up will occur among those identifying suicidality and/or 
self-harm. Clinical coaches will also follow-up with par -
ticipants who identified suicidality on the online com -
munity forum and/or in weekly group telehealth sessions. 
The University of Manitoba’s standard procedures for 
reporting adverse events and protocol violations/devia -
tions will be followed.
Frequency and plans for auditing trial conduct {23}
It is possible that the University of Manitoba Research 
Ethics Board may request an audit; however, the study 
team has no plans to conduct an independent audit.
Ethics and dissemination
Research ethics approval {24}
The protocol for this RCT has been approved by and 
will be performed in accordance with the University of 
Manitoba’s REB (HE2021-0217).
Protocol amendments {25}
Amendments to this protocol will be submitted to 
the University of Manitoba’s REB who will review and 
approve amendments prior to implementation. Par -
ticipants will re-consent to amendments, if required. 
Amendments will also be submitted as updates on Clini -
calTrials.gov.
Confidentiality {27}
The BEAM program will be provided on a secure plat -
form. Participant confidentiality will be protected 
throughout the study in accordance with the University of Manitoba’s REB guidelines, with exceptions to confi -
dentiality including suspected cases of child maltreat -
ment (abuse, neglect, or endangerment) and imminent 
harm to self or others. Only specific individuals will have 
access to data who are trained in the University of Mani -
toba’s ethics and data safety protocols, have completed 
PHIA training, and have taken an oath of confidentiality.
All data, including identifying information, will be 
password protected and stored on REDCap [31]. All 
data will be associated with a de-identified participant 
identification number. A password-protected master list 
will be kept containing the first names and last initials, 
email addresses, phone numbers, and group allocation of 
participants. This master list will only be accessible by a 
research assistant.
Precautions will be taken to manage confidentiality on 
the online community forums which will include a Data 
Management Protocol, participant agreed upon Terms of 
Use (i.e., no personally identifying/health information, no 
identifiable photographs). Coaches will have the ability to 
remove posts which violate the terms of use and partici -
pants will be emailed should any concerns arise. Security 
measures also include monitoring of the forums by the 
study team and the ability for other participants to anon -
ymously flag posts for review.
During the weekly telehealth group sessions, par -
ticipant anonymity cannot be guaranteed. Telehealth 
sessions will be hosted on a secure Zoom Healthcare 
account which is password-protected. At the first group 
session, the clinical coaches will outline limitations of 
confidentiality and anonymity. Participant attendance 
and client records will be tracked through the Titanium 
platform, hosted by the University of Manitoba Psycho -
logical Service Centre, which is PHIA-compliant.
Declaration of interests {28}
The authors of this RCT declare no conflicts of interest.
Access to data {29}
All data will be housed in a secure database accessible by 
the study investigators.
Ancillary and post -trial care {30}
If it is determined that a mother requires further services, 
they will be referred to a clinician or clinic, and provided 
with a list of mental health resources.
Dissemination policy {31a}
Research findings will be disseminated to academic and 
public audiences. Several publications describing the 
feasibility of the BEAM program will be published in 
peer-reviewed journals following Consolidated Stand -
ard of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines and the 
Page 12 of 14 Joyce et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:35 
CONSORT extension for pilot and feasibility trials [68, 
69]. Manuscripts will be posted rapidly on preprint serv -
ers, such as psyarxiv.com, and open access (through pub -
lishers and/or repositories) for a wider reach. The study 
investigators and research trainees will present findings 
at national and international conferences. Our knowl -
edge mobilization plan follows an integrated knowledge 
translation approach [70]. At the patient level, we will 
employ multiple strategies to understand and address 
the unique stressors relevant to maternal depression and 
anxiety. The PAB is committed to dissemination efforts 
by contributing to lay summaries, infographics, and shar -
ing in parenting groups/forums. Our agency partner, 
Family Dynamics, will distribute results with their net -
works. Collaborating agencies, i.e., Public Health Agency 
of Canada, The Department of Families, and Canadian 
Perinatal Mental Health Collaborative, will aid in the 
sharing of results to network funders, boards, and policy 
makers. Qualitative focus group interviews with partici -
pants and coaches are planned to gain information and to 
inform program improvements.
Authorship eligibility guidelines {31b}
Individuals will be considered eligible for authorship 
if they contributed to the design, conduct, analysis, or 
interpretation of the data. Professional writers will not be 
used for manuscript preparation.
Plans to give access to the full protocol, participant -level 
data, and statistical code {31c}
De-identified data may be made available on public data 
platforms such as the Open Science Framework or if 
made a requirement by the granting agency, journal, or 
community partner. Statistical code used to conduct 
analyses for published manuscripts may also be included 
on public data platforms, allowing other researchers to 
assess the studies’ scientific rigor.
Discussion
BEAM is an app-based maternal mental health program 
which is easily accessible and was designed to scale. 
The program targets peer connection, psychoeduca -
tion, and intervention by mental health professionals 
and has the potential to mitigate the negative impacts 
of maternal mental health concerns and stress on fam -
ily well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and 
beyond. The proposed RCT will build upon our prior 
research on the BEAM program [24] through partner -
ship with a local community agency, Family Dynam -
ics, as agencies commonly lack infrastructure and 
personnel to adequately treat maternal mental health 
concerns. In partnership with family agencies, BEAM 
holds the potential to promote maternal-child mental health through the provision of mHealth content, train -
ing, and consultation. Findings will provide informa -
tion on the feasibility, engagement, and accessibility of 
the BEAM program and will inform future RCTs of the 
BEAM program.
Trial status
Recruitment began in January 2022 and finished in 
March 2022. The date of first enrollment was February 
14th, 2022. The intervention launched in April 2022 (with 
estimated completion in December 2022 for the collec -
tion of all primary outcomes).
